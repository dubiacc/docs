- **Certain New Age movements**
- **Process Theology** (Christian variant)

### Dualistic

- **Gnosticism** (various schools)
- **Manichaeism**
- **Catharism**
- **Some forms of Zoroastrianism**

### Non-strictly philosophical 

- **Stoicism** - Derives meaning from virtue and living according to nature/reason, but doesn't require supernatural beliefs. The focus is on what's within our control rather than external goods or power.
- **Existentialism** (particularly Sartrean) - Embraces the absence of inherent meaning but argues we create authentic meaning through radical freedom and responsibility. Unlike nihilism, it doesn't lead to despair but to authentic self-creation.
- **Absurdism** (Camus) - Acknowledges life's meaninglessness but advocates for revolt against this condition through continued engagement with life despite its absurdity. The struggle itself becomes meaningful.
- **Philosophical Taoism** - Seeks harmony with the natural flow of existence (Tao) without necessarily invoking supernatural elements. Meaning comes from wu wei (effortless action) and balance.
- **Humanism** - Centers human dignity, reason, and compassion as sources of meaning without requiring theistic belief. Unlike your "secular quasi-religions," classical humanism doesn't typically fixate on utopian endpoints.
- **Virtue Ethics** (secular Aristotelian) - Focuses on character development and human flourishing (eudaimonia) as intrinsic goods, independent of supernatural grounding.
- **Pragmatism** - Judges ideas by their practical consequences and workability rather than their correspondence to ultimate truth or divine will.

The theistic traditions, while they may have their own pathologies, at least maintain the proper categorical 
distinction between finite and infinite, relative and absolute.

### Materialistic

- **Money-worship** → hyper-capitalism with financialized everything
- **Knowledge-worship** → technocracy/scientism with expertise as ultimate authority  
- **Sex-worship** → gender ideology wars and demographic collapse
- **Blood-worship** → ethno-nationalism and racial essentialism
- **Status-worship** → social media narcissism and virtue signaling
- **Authority-worship** → totalitarian movements (fascism/communism)

The "man creating God" process follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Rejection** of objective transcendent meaning
2. **Vacuum** creates unbearable existential anxiety  
3. **Substitution** with finite good elevated to ultimate status
4. **Rationalization** through intellectual systems that justify the new "god"
5. **Evangelization** to resolve cognitive dissonance through mass conversion

This explains why materialist ideologies become so aggressive—they're not just philosophical 
positions but desperate attempts to create **meaning ex nihilo**.

## Aquinas's Critique of Non-Catholic Christianity

### **Against Eastern Orthodox**

**1. Papal Authority**

- **Aquinas's Position**: Christ established Peter as head of Church (Matthew 16:18-19)
- **Against Orthodox**: Collegiate system cannot provide doctrinal unity
- **Historical Argument**: Early councils required papal confirmation
- **Practical Problem**: Orthodox churches split along national lines

**2. Filioque Clause**

- **Aquinas's Defense**: Holy Spirit proceeds from Father "and Son" (*filioque*)
- **Theological Argument**: Maintains distinction between Son and Spirit
- **Against Orthodox**: "From Father alone" makes Son and Spirit too similar
- **Scriptural Support**: John 15:26, 16:7 show Son's role in Spirit's mission

**3. Clerical Celibacy**

- **Aquinas's Support**: Celibacy allows complete dedication to ministry
- **Against Married Priests**: Divided loyalties between family and flock
- **Theological Argument**: Priests represent Christ, who was celibate
- **Practical Advantage**: Prevents hereditary church offices

### **Against Protestant Doctrines**

**1. Sola Scriptura**

- **Aquinas's Critique**: Scripture requires authoritative interpretation
- **Against Private Judgment**: Leads to endless divisions and heresy
- **Historical Argument**: Church preceded and determined biblical canon
- **Logical Problem**: Scripture doesn't teach *sola scriptura*

**2. Justification by Faith Alone**

- **Aquinas's Position**: Faith must be accompanied by charity (love)
- **Against Luther**: Faith without works is dead (James 2:26)
- **Theological Argument**: Justification involves real transformation, not just imputation
- **Sacramental Necessity**: Baptism actually removes original sin

**3. Predestination (Calvinism)**

- **Aquinas's Critique**: Double predestination makes God author of evil
- **Against Limited Atonement**: Christ died for all humanity
- **Free Will Defense**: God's grace enables but doesn't compel response
- **Scriptural Support**: 1 Timothy 2:4 - God wills all to be saved

### **Against Restorationist Claims**

**1. Against Mormon Theology**

- **Apostasy Theory**: Church could not fail completely (Matthew 16:18)
- **Against Polytheism**: One God in three persons, not multiple gods
- **Biblical Sufficiency**: No need for additional revelations
- **Historical Continuity**: No evidence of total apostasy

**2. Against Jehovah's Witnesses**

- **Trinity Defense**: Jesus is truly God (John 1:1, 8:58)
- **Against Arianism**: Condemned at Nicaea (325 CE)
- **Scriptural Interpretation**: Watchtower translations distort Greek text
- **Organizational Critique**: False prophets by biblical standards

### **Aquinas's Methodological Approach**

**1. Philosophical Consistency**

- Shows how Catholic doctrine harmonizes faith and reason
- Demonstrates logical problems in Protestant/Orthodox positions
- Uses Aristotelian framework to clarify theological concepts

**2. Historical Continuity**

- Argues for unbroken apostolic succession
- Shows development of doctrine rather than corruption
- Demonstrates Catholic Church's unique authority claims

**3. Scriptural Interpretation**

- Uses Church Fathers and councils for authoritative interpretation
- Shows how Catholic practices flow from scriptural foundations
- Demonstrates dangers of private interpretation

**4. Sacramental Theology**

- Shows how Catholic sacraments convey grace *ex opere operato*
- Critiques Protestant reduction of sacraments to symbols
- Demonstrates necessity of ordained priesthood

Aquinas's approach treats Eastern Orthodox with more respect (as preserving apostolic succession) than 
Protestants (who broke succession) or Restorationists (who claim false revelations), but maintains 
Catholic superiority in all cases through philosophical rigor and historical continuity.

## Dualistic Traditions

### Gnosticism (Various Schools)

Gnosticism encompassed diverse 2nd-4th century movements sharing common themes of cosmic dualism, 
esoteric knowledge, and spiritual salvation through gnosis (direct experiential knowledge). Major 
schools included Valentinian, Sethian, and Mandaean traditions.

**Core Gnostic Themes:** The material world results from a cosmic catastrophe involving the fall of divine 
emanations (aeons) from the perfect spiritual realm (pleroma). A lesser deity or demiurge (often identified 
with the Hebrew God) creates the material world as a prison for divine sparks trapped in human souls. Salvation 
comes through gnosis - direct revelation of one's true divine nature and the means of escape from material bondage.

**Valentinian Gnosticism** developed elaborate mythologies describing the fall of Sophia (Wisdom) and the 
resulting creation of the material world. They taught that humanity contains three classes: spiritual (pneumatic), 
psychic, and material, with only the spiritual capable of achieving salvation through gnosis.

**Sethian Gnosticism** emphasized the figure of Seth (Adam's son) as the progenitor of the spiritual race. 
They developed complex cosmologies involving multiple heavens, divine emanations, and the spiritual journey 
through celestial realms.

**Mandaean Tradition** (surviving in Iraq/Iran) maintains ancient Gnostic practices including baptismal rituals, 
esoteric texts, and emphasis on the soul's ascent through hostile planetary spheres to reach the world of light.

### Manichaeism

Founded by Mani (216-274 CE) in Sassanid Persia, Manichaeism presented a systematic dualistic religion that spread 
from Western Europe to China. Mani claimed to complete the revelations of Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus by providing 
the final universal religion.

**Cosmological Dualism:** Manichaeism taught absolute dualism between the Kingdom of Light (ruled by the Father of 
Greatness) and the Kingdom of Darkness (ruled by the Prince of Darkness). These realms existed eternally in opposition, 
with the material world resulting from their cosmic conflict.

**Anthropological Dualism:** Humans contain both light particles (soul) trapped in dark matter (body). The light 
elements seek reunion with their divine source, while dark elements resist spiritual liberation. This creates 
fundamental conflict within human nature between spiritual and material impulses.

**Soteriological System:** Salvation involves liberating light particles through ascetic practices, vegetarianism, 
and avoidance of procreation (which further traps light in matter). The religion included elaborate hierarchies of 
elect (perfect practitioners) and hearers (lay followers) with different spiritual obligations.

### Catharism

Catharism flourished in medieval Southern France (12th-14th centuries) before being suppressed by the Albigensian 
Crusade and Inquisition. The movement likely derived from earlier Bogomil traditions in the Byzantine Empire.

**Dualistic Cosmology:** Cathars taught that the material world was created by Satan (the demiurge) in opposition 
to the good God who rules the spiritual realm. They viewed the Hebrew Bible as largely the work of the evil creator, 
while accepting New Testament teachings about spiritual salvation.

**Anthropological Teachings:** Humans possess divine souls trapped in material bodies created by the evil principle. 
The soul's goal is escape from the cycle of reincarnation through spiritual purification and rejection of material attachments.

**Religious Practice:** Catharism distinguished between perfecti (the perfect) who received the consolamentum 
(spiritual baptism) and practiced extreme asceticism, and credentes (believers) who supported the perfect while 
living ordinary lives. The perfecti avoided meat, sexual activity, and material possessions while dedicating 
themselves to prayer and spiritual instruction.

### Some Forms of Zoroastrianism

While classical Zoroastrianism is often interpreted as ethical dualism (good vs. evil forces under one supreme deity), 
certain developments emphasized more absolute dualistic interpretations.

**Zurvanite Zoroastrianism** (Sassanid period) posited Zurvan (Infinite Time) as the ultimate principle who gave birth 
to twin spirits: Ahura Mazda (good) and Angra Mainyu (evil). This created a more symmetrical dualism where good and evil 
derive from a common transcendent source.

**Manichaean Interpretations:** Some Zoroastrian traditions, particularly those influenced by Manichaeism, emphasized the 
cosmic struggle between light and darkness as fundamental features of reality rather than temporary conditions to be resolved.

**Metaphysical Dualism:** Certain interpretations viewed spirit and matter as fundamentally opposed principles, with the 
material world representing the realm of evil and spiritual salvation requiring escape from material existence.

## Aquinas's Potential Philosophical Attacks

### Against Gnosticism:

Aquinas would launch a comprehensive assault on Gnostic dualism, arguing that it violates divine unity and omnipotence 
by positing rival principles of good and evil. He would contend that the demiurge concept inappropriately separates 
divine creative power from divine goodness, making creation itself evil.

He would oppose their understanding of matter as inherently evil, arguing instead that all being, including material 
existence, is fundamentally good as created by God. His doctrine of creation ex nihilo would directly contradict their 
emanationist cosmologies and the notion that matter results from divine error or fall.

Aquinas would challenge their elitist soteriology, arguing that salvation is available to all humans through divine 
grace, not restricted to those possessing special gnosis. He would contend that their emphasis on esoteric knowledge 
over faith and good works contradicts the accessibility of divine truth through natural reason and revelation.

He would particularly oppose their docetistic Christology (Christ only appeared to have a material body), arguing that 
genuine incarnation requires the hypostatic union of divine and human natures, including true material embodiment.

### Against Manichaeism:

Aquinas would consider Manichaeism perhaps the most philosophically dangerous dualistic system due to its systematic and 
comprehensive nature. He would argue that positing two eternal principles violates the principle of divine unity and 
creates logical contradictions - there cannot be two infinite, eternal substances.

He would challenge their absolute dualism by arguing that evil is not a positive substance but rather the privation of 
good. His doctrine of evil as privatio boni would directly contradict their understanding of darkness as a positive 
competing principle with light.

Aquinas would oppose their understanding of the material world as inherently evil, arguing instead that material 
creation is good as the work of divine wisdom. He would contend that their extreme asceticism reflects a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the proper relationship between soul and body.

He would challenge their deterministic anthropology, arguing that humans possess free will and can choose between good 
and evil, rather than being predetermined by their possession of light or dark particles.

### Against Catharism:

Aquinas would oppose Cathar dualism as a revival of Manichaean errors adapted to Christian language. He would argue that 
their identification of the Hebrew God with Satan contradicts divine unity and the continuity of salvation history from 
Old to New Testament.

He would challenge their understanding of the material world as Satan's creation, arguing instead that God created all 
things good, including matter. Their rejection of marriage and procreation would be seen as contrary to natural law and 
divine blessing of human fertility.

Aquinas would oppose their doctrine of reincarnation as contradicting the unity of soul and body and the resurrection 
of the dead. He would argue that individual souls are created directly by God and achieve their final destiny through 
judgment, not through cycles of rebirth.

He would challenge their two-tier system of perfecti and credentes, arguing that Christian perfection is a goal for 
all believers, not restricted to a spiritual elite practicing extreme asceticism.

### Against Dualistic Zoroastrianism:

Aquinas would oppose Zurvanite interpretations that posit Infinite Time as superior to Ahura Mazda, arguing that this 
compromises divine transcendence and makes God subordinate to abstract principles. He would contend that true divinity 
must be personal and intelligent, not merely temporal or cosmic.

He would challenge their understanding of good and evil as co-eternal principles, arguing instead that evil is the 
privation of good and cannot exist as an independent metaphysical principle. Their symmetrical dualism would be seen 
as philosophically incoherent.

Aquinas would oppose their interpretation of the cosmic struggle as fundamental to reality's structure, arguing 
instead that divine providence governs all events toward ultimate good, and that apparent evil serves larger 
purposes in divine wisdom.

### Fundamental Philosophical Objections:

**Divine Unity and Simplicity:** Across all dualistic traditions, Aquinas would emphasize that genuine divinity 
requires absolute unity and simplicity. Dualistic systems either multiply supreme beings (logical contradiction) 
or make God limited by opposing forces (compromising divine omnipotence).

**The Problem of Evil:** He would argue that these traditions, in attempting to solve the problem of evil by 
positing evil principles, actually create greater philosophical problems. His doctrine of evil as privation 
provides a more coherent explanation that preserves divine goodness and omnipotence.

**Matter and Creation:** Aquinas would consistently oppose their denigration of material existence, arguing 
that matter is good as created by God and that the soul-body unity reflects divine wisdom rather than cosmic error.

**Salvation and Grace:** He would contend that dualistic systems, by emphasizing esoteric knowledge or extreme 
asceticism, neglect the necessity of divine grace and the accessibility of salvation through faith, hope, and charity.

**Epistemological Critique:** He would argue that these traditions demonstrate how human reason, when separated 
from divine revelation and proper philosophical method, can construct elaborate but fundamentally false systems 
that lead away from rather than toward truth.

**Christological Objections:** Against Gnostic and Cathar Christologies, he would emphasize that Christ's true 
humanity (including material body) is essential to redemption - only genuine incarnation can bridge the gap 
between divine and human natures.

Aquinas would conclude that dualistic traditions represent sophisticated but ultimately flawed attempts to 
address genuine spiritual problems (evil, suffering, material limitations) through philosophical systems that 
compromise fundamental truths about divine unity, creation's goodness, and human nature. He would see them as 
particularly dangerous because they appear to take spiritual concerns seriously while actually undermining the 
metaphysical foundations necessary for genuine spiritual life.
