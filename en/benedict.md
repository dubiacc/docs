"Vademecum" of the errors of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI, extracted from the 
Osservatore Romano. From: "Documentation on the Revolution in the Church" 06/2025

# The Errors of Pope Benedict XVI

Pope Benedict XVI changed the Catholic religion to another without warning us. 

Benedict XVI, as they themselves acknowledge, is the master of "Catholic" modernist thought before, during, and after the Second Vatican Council. The other popes apply his doctrine. His errors are taught in seminaries with his "Opera Omnia." He will be declared a saint and a doctor of the Church.

This is the Revolution in the Church, only the Counter-revolution can understand and eliminate these errors.

## Some quotes upfront

Our objective is to report the errors so that they are not forgotten and can be found. What is happening in the Church with Vatican II is that for 60 years the Revolution has officially entered the Catholic Church as Saint Pius X foresaw in "Our Apostolic Mandate": "The spirit of the Revolution has passed this way."

So to disinfect the Church, one must be well aware that this is the Revolution. One must also be well-versed in the traditional Magisterium and the Counter-Revolution; only in this way can the Church be liberated. Mgr. Lefebvre denounces liberalism in his book "A Bishop Speaks": "There were time bombs in the Council... three... collegiality, religious freedom, ecumenism," and during a retreat in Écône in 1990, he said: "And we too have chosen to be counter-revolutionaries." The future pope, "perfectly Catholic," as Mgr. Lefebvre hopes, will have to correct all the errors of Benedict XVI.

Here are some of the most serious doctrines taught by Benedict XVI and published in the Osservatore Romano.

### Anti-Marian Revolution

*   **Theologian Ratzinger, "Introduction to Christianity" (original title): "The conception of Jesus is not a procreation on the part of God."** text reissued under the pontificate of Benedict XVI in an article in L'O.R. of 25.12.2008. See the study on my site Doc Rév. in the Church year 2020, p. 3.

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 24.08.2006:** "This Woman represents Mary... but she simultaneously represents the entire Church, the People of God."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.12.2008:** "Mary was the first to be freed from the original fall of our first parents." [freed or preserved?]

### False restoration

*   **Card. Ratzinger in the Italian magazine "Jesus" (Nov. 1984):** "If by restoration one means to go back, then no restoration is possible."
*   **Card. Ratzinger, "The Ratzinger Report" (chap.II) 1985:** "If by restoration one means to go back, then no restoration is possible."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 07.06.2008:** "We must welcome 'the true achievements of the Enlightenment.'"
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 08.07.2007:** "Missale Romanum... of 1962... Mgr Lefebvre, but the reasons for this rift have deeper roots... the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council."

> **The popes of Vatican II teach the opposite of the popes before them. How can one disobey the doctrine that all Popes, always and everywhere have taught?**

**Notice:** you can verify these citations either by purchasing CDs from the Osservatore Romano, or directly on the Internet by entering the name of the pope, the occasion on which he gave the speech and the date, they often give you the full text.

### Revolution of the Papacy

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 26.07.2009:** "The function of the priesthood is to consecrate the world so that it becomes a living host, so that the world becomes liturgy...

### Ecumenism

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 27.01.2013:** "Communion in the same faith [in the same doctrine]... Without faith... the entire ecumenical movement would be reduced to a 'form of contract' to which one adheres out of common interest."

*   **"Pope" Benedict XVI, also as pope emeritus, still writes his theories in the Osservatore, O.R. 15.12.2016:** "The council fathers... did not want to create a different faith or a new Church but to unite them both [so there are two churches: the Church of all time and the conciliar church] more deeply and thus truly renew them. Therefore a hermeneutic of rupture is absurd." [Ratzinger had the intuition that it was not necessary to make "a new Church," otherwise the old one would remain intact, "but to unite them both" to "truly renew them."]
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 02.11.2009:** "On Oct. 31, 1999 in Augsburg the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification was signed... This document attests to an agreement between Lutherans and Catholics on fundamental truths concerning the doctrine of Justification."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 04.03.2006:** "'No' to the romanticism of the past, a just and necessary 'No'... thus as a historical faith [Here is Benedict XVI's fundamental thesis: to historicize faith in order to change it]... had opened its door to modernity."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI to Muslims, O.R.07.11.2008:** "We all can, and must, be worshipers of the one God... Let us decide to overcome the prejudices of the past and to correct the often distorted image of the other."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 16.01.2011:** "Ecumenism is not our work, but the fruit of God's action."

### Judaization of the Church

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 14.09.2008:** "The Catholic Church desires to respect the Covenant concluded by the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. She too is part of the eternal Covenant of the Almighty whose designs are without repentance, beloved brothers in the faith... the Jews."
*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI: Card. Albert Vanhoye O.R. 06.10.2008:** "Far from substituting itself for Israel, the Church remains in solidarity with it."
*   **Riccardo Segni, Chief Rabbi of Rome, writes the editorial of O.R. 08.10.2008:** "A Jew who has Kippur does not need the salvation proposed by the Christian faith."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 21.11.2010:** "'Christianity and modernity'...'Judaism'... in my proclamation of the Christian faith, this loving intertwining between Israel and the Church had to be central... In the old liturgy too, a change seemed necessary to me... in such a way that one does not pray directly for the conversion of the Jews in the missionary sense."
*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI, Card. Lustiger. O.R. 23.01.2010:** "Jew and cardinal... 'For me, there was never any question of denying my Jewish identity... A perverse theology of 'verus Israel', that is, that the Church replaces Israel and nullifies it. No!... 'Christ... does not substitute himself for Israel.'"
*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the B'nai B'rith O.R. 13.05.2011:** "We can do together is to bear a common witness to our Creed... I call upon you and your families the divine blessings."

### Revolution in Exegesis

*   **Card. Ratzinger "The new people of God" (Part III, ch.III no.3, a):** "Encyclical theology means a form of theology in which tradition seemed to shrink... to the declarations... of the papal magisterium... On the contrary, a critique of the documents of the popes that are not supported by Holy Scripture will be possible and necessary." [The source of Revelation is also oral Tradition, for example for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, of the Assumption].
*   **Card. Ratzinger, O.R. 10.05.2003:** "It is no longer the Magisterium that from above imposes norms on exegetes."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 07.11.2005:** "It is indeed the Word of God, which through the action of the Holy Spirit, guides the faithful to the fullness of truth."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. French ed., 19.10.2006:** "Judas... it is he who out of love 'delivered' Jesus for us all... God assumes the inexcusable gesture of Judas."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 06.10.2008:** "The foundation of all reality is solely the Word of God... the great truth of God... towards the universality that gathers everyone, that unites us all and makes us all brothers."

*   **M. Fontana. O.R. 25.05.2008:** "Very important is the contribution of the book 'Jesus of Nazareth' by Ratzinger which... takes into account the achievements of a historical and literary analysis of the text."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI [In addition to "the Great Church": O.R. 13.03.2009, and "the great truth": O.R. 06.10.2008, Pope Ratzinger also invented "the Great Tradition"], O.R. 24.04.2009:** "For a correct interpretation of a historical-literary character, as the first dimension of all exegesis... Living Tradition... to be faithful to the Church means, in fact, to place oneself in the current of the Great Tradition."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 29.01.2009:** "The majority of exegetes today are of the opinion that these Letters would not have been written by St. Paul himself."

### Liturgical Revolution

*   **Theologian Ratzinger "The new people of God":** "The unitary ecclesiastical law, the unitary liturgy, the unitary assignment of episcopal sees by the Roman central authority, these are things that do not necessarily flow from the primacy as such, (Part II, ch. 4)... The liturgical reform of the Council thus appears not only legitimate, but even necessary (Part III, ch. 4,1)."
*   **Card. Ratzinger, speech to the bishops of Chile, "Concilium", 1988:** "To draw the direct conclusion: it is necessary to recover the sacred dimension of the liturgy... It is necessary to defend the Second Vatican Council against Mgr Lefebvre, as a duty that obliges vis-à-vis the Church and as a permanent necessity... Now, leaving aside the liturgical question, the central point of the conflict lies in the attack on religious freedom and against the alleged spirit of Assisi." [Thank you for confirming this for us.]
*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI O.R. 26.10.2001:** "The Anaphora of Addai and Mari... is used without the narrative of the Institution [of the Eucharist]... the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Card. Ratzinger), has come to the conclusion that this Anaphora can be considered valid."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 08.07.2007:** "We all know that, in the movement led by Archbishop Mgr. Lefebvre, fidelity to the old Missal has become its external symbol; but the reasons for this rift have deeper roots [We agree with Benedict XVI that it is not about the issue of the Mass, that is, the Mass can be celebrated but only if religious freedom is accepted]. Many people who clearly accepted the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council..."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 09.11.2009:** "The ordinariate has the faculty to celebrate... according to the liturgical books proper to the Anglican tradition."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 26.07.2009:** "The function of the priesthood is to consecrate the world so that it becomes a living host, so that the world becomes liturgy... The world itself becomes a living host, that it becomes liturgy. This is also the great vision that Teilhard de Chardin had."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 21.11.2010:** "That one does not pray directly for the conversion of the Jews in the missionary sense."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 07.05.2011:** "Vatican II... In order to renew the mentality... The liturgy, with its universal capacity for celebration, thus becomes the great educator... the liturgy renews the Church."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 18.06.2012:** "Vatican II, an event that launched the greatest renewal of the Roman rite ever seen in the Church... with very great results." ["great", but bad]
*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI. Card. Tauran, O.R. 12.12.2012:** "To modify the liturgy means to modify the idea we have of God, of the priest and of the Church." [We are painfully in agreement]

### Revolution of Canon Law

*   **Card. Ratzinger an archive article. O.R. 02.10.2010:** "Canon law which was to be inserted into the theological vision of the Church formulated by the Council."

### Pacifism and Immigration

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 13.12.2006:** "A war in the name of God is never acceptable."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 28.10.2011:** "In 1989, three years after Assisi, the (Berlin) wall fell. Suddenly the enormous arsenals that were behind the wall had no more reason to exist... yes, in history, even in the name of the Christian faith, violence has been used. We recognize this with great shame."
*   **Pope Benedict O.R.01.12.2011:** "Abolish the death penalty."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 19.1.2009:** "Thus valuing the phenomenon of immigration as an opportunity for encounter between civilizations." ["opportunity" to do ecumenism]
*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 26.10.2011:** "Migrations and new evangelization... Welcoming migratory flows."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 19.11.2011:** "To exhort the Church, in this situation, to persevere in the esteem of 'Muslims who worship one God'... The new evangelization."

### Catholic Communism

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 01.09.2005:** "The great significance of Solidarnosc... I know how much it was at heart... that Europe could breathe with two lungs... I know... I also know that... the fall of the Berlin Wall... is the most striking proof of this."

> **1 John 5:4: "The victory that overcomes the world is our faith," and not the betrayals of the faith.**

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 25.03.2012:** "The word 'Liberation Theology', which can also be interpreted for good, will help us a lot."
*   **Pope Benedict XVI prepares the agreement with China. "Vatican.va":** "'Explanatory Note', Benedict XVI's letter to Chinese Catholics of May 27, 2007: 'Letter to the bishops, priests, consecrated persons and lay faithful of the Catholic Church in the People's Republic of China'... I hereby revoke all the faculties that had been granted to deal with particular pastoral needs, which arose in particularly difficult times." [It is therefore Benedict XVI who forbade the true clandestine Catholic bishops from carrying out clandestine consecrations and ordinations.]

**The Left has understood that Ratzinger's "Restoration" is a false restoration... and what about us?** [see on our site the bulletin "The pseudo restoration" with the texts from the left]

### Intermediate conclusion

Mgr Lefebvre warns us against the new problems that will arise in case of an agreement with the Vatican. The survival operation of Tradition. Extract from the Conference of June 11, 1988. Taken from the CD "For the Love of the Church":

> "On May 24, I wrote to the Cardinal: 'The purpose of the talks and the reconciliation is to reintegrate us into the conciliar Church.'... And especially if there were an arrangement, even more so! Because, invaded by a quantity of people who will come: 'Ah now you have the Tradition, you have the Tradition and recognized by Rome, so we will come, we will come to you.' But a quantity of people who will keep their modern spirit, who will keep their liberal spirit... And that will be very dangerous for our circles: if we are invaded by that world, you see, what will become of Tradition? Little by little there will be this kind of osmosis that will occur and this kind of consensus, like this: 'And after all, the new mass is not so bad! We must not exaggerate.' Slowly, slowly we will end up no longer seeing the distinction between liberalism and tradition, and all that. Very dangerous, you see. You know when one is contaminated by liberal ideas, one contaminates others. It's fatal, like a real contagious disease, it's dangerous, very dangerous. Whereas for the moment we are well in the Tradition, in the Fraternity we hold as firmly as possible.
>
> But if we do not have the means, once again, to defend ourselves either in Rome or by the bishops we must have to protect us, so that they are bishops who have the same thoughts as us, who will preach as we preach, who have the same ideas as us and who will consequently maintain the Catholic faith in our circles, well we are lost! We are lost, we will no longer be able to hold on, it is no longer possible. That is why here too, dear friends, if there are some among you who really do not agree, with for example the consecration of bishops, or I don't know, not in agreement on certain problems, such as precisely that of absolutely refusing the new mass or for example on the subject of religious freedom, if there are some who do not agree, who believe that religious freedom is not bad, that it is a mistake to fight against religious freedom, etc., they must not stay with us.

If subjects begin to be contaminated in our midst and slowly, slowly it's one, it's two, it's three, it's four, it's five; and then slowly the ideas begin to soften, to soften in the fight. If there are soldiers who begin to no longer have the courage to fight, who begin to stand a little aside saying 'oh oh, I don't know, we don't know if we can go, we're not going, we don't know what we're doing.' Then it's over, you see the influence that has on others! With that one has the impression that some always stay behind, that they do not want to fight, so it demoralizes the fighters, but yes. Now, our fight, my dear friends, is a fight that is not difficult: we want the Reign of Our Lord Jesus Christ, that's what I said."

## Introduction

We give you here the most complete list of the errors of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI, errors extracted from the Osservatore Romano. There is a lot of material to study and we present here only the most important ideas. This work is a synthesis, a "vademecum," for priests and laity, with the aim of always having at hand a global and synthetic vision, so as not to forget the errors of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI which are repeated and will always be repeated. We want above all to show and make people understand the false restoration of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI, in order to foresee and prepare for the next false restoration, with which they are trying to recover traditionalist Catholics and this will continue until modernism is eliminated from the Roman Church.

The citations and dates are taken from the Osservatore Romano. The most complete texts are available on our site [marcel-lefebvre-tam.com](http://marcel-lefebvre-tam.com/).

There are not many people who have the time and the facility to know Benedict XVI. We want to make our modest contribution. This helps to understand the past, the present and to predict the future of Vatican II. Pope Benedict XVI is, doctrinally, much worse and much more elaborate than Pope Francis, who, in another aspect, is more theatrical and many Catholics do not know this and are content with the media image to which the liberal-Marxist system in which we live subjects us.

Benedict XVI subverted all theology in its philosophical and theological foundations, in fact, the Opera Omnia of Benedict XVI is studied in "conservative" seminaries while Pope Francis has put it into practice in a more popular way but only in a few points. 

For example, Francis does not speak and does not theorize or very little, all the modernist doctrines of Benedict XVI on religious freedom, ecumenism, anti-Marian doctrine, false restoration, the Agreement on the doctrine of justification, the replacement of the Magisterium by Scripture, the introduction of Anglican priests and married bishops into the Church, Judaization, etc. On the contrary, at the time of Benedict XVI, the Osservatore Romano insisted doctrinally, every day, on modernist themes. Read the Osservatore Romano and you will see.

The media made you believe that Benedict XVI was a "conservative" (that is to say a moderate, not a progressive) and, to make us swallow this image, made concessions, for example on the traditional Mass, but always on the condition of accepting Vatican II with the liberalism of freedom of conscience condemned by the previous Magisterium. This is a bait to attract those who do not know the "infallible and irreformable" magisterium of the previous popes.

The Left, in a Catholic-communist magazine in Rome, with mocking lucidity, justifies the fact that Ratzinger must present himself as a conservative to get the changes in the Church passed. "Adista" 30.04.2005: "If the Church needs changes, Ratzinger could have said [at the Conclave]... it is good that I lead them myself: it will be easier to make them accepted."

This speech by Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia is a synthesis of his thought and his pontificate. Believe what he says. 
He himself wants to show it openly and he wants to be recognized for it.

Benedict XVI was elected pope on April 19, 2005. Pope Benedict XVI, after resigning on February 11, 2013 and before the election of Pope Francis on March 13, 2013, he made a summary of the Revolution in the Church of Vatican II and of his pontificate, he himself makes it explicit, like a testament, for those who would not have understood it yet:

> The most prepared, let's say those who had better defined intentions, were the French, German, Belgian and Dutch episcopates, the so-called 'Rhine alliance' [this is confirmed by the book: 'The Rhine flows into the Tiber', by Wiltgen]... It was they who showed the way... The first of the reforms... was the liturgical one... the second ecclesiology; the third the word of God, Revelation... We began to put forward the concept of 'People of God'... a concept that implies the continuity of the Testaments... But it was only after the Council that an element was brought to light, which in the Council itself remained a little hidden, that is: the link between 'People of God' and 'Body of Christ'. It is truly communion with Christ in the Eucharistic union. Here we become the Body of Christ; that is to say that the relationship between People of God and Body of Christ creates a new reality: communion... We have directed towards this concept... communion as a central conception. [This is Ratzinger's theory that whoever has a valid Eucharist is part of the Church]. ... And finally ecumenism... Concerning these themes, the 'Rhine alliance' had, so to speak, done its work. [He can affirm this since he was part of it]... Religious freedom,... America, the United States, were very interested in religious freedom. In the third period of the Council they said to the pope: We cannot go home without taking with us in our luggage a declaration on religious freedom voted by the council... [And Pope Ratzinger concludes with the false restoration]: The true Council had difficulties in materializing... But the real strength of the Council was there and it is being realized progressively and ever more... it is also the true reform and the true renewal of the Church.

**NOTE:** you will see that some articles are repeated because they are useful to illustrate the themes of the different chapters. We accompany these texts with comments that help even the faithful, the less prepared, to understand the seriousness and consequences of the errors. We apologize for any spelling and syntax errors, also because we use the translator and the material is more abundant than the time we have. We seek above all to make known the most important modernist material, leaving to others the task of doing a more refined work.

## Anti-Marian Revolution

*   **1968 He teaches this in his book "Introduction to Christianity" (original title "Einführung in das Christentum") (Part II, 4, 2.1):**
    > "The conception of Jesus is not a procreation on the part of God." "The divine sonship of Jesus does not rest, according to the faith of the Church, on the fact that Jesus had no human father; the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus would not be questioned, if Jesus had been born of a normal marriage."
    *As pope, he had it published again in the Osservatore Romano by Card. Ravasi on 25.12.2008.*

*   **1985 Cardinal Ratzinger, in "The Ratzinger Report", 1985, he asks himself (chap. 7, par. 6):**
    > "These dogmas... of the Assumption... one wonders if... we have not prepared for our Protestant brothers unnecessary obstacles on the path to unity."

*   **1995 Card. Ratzinger, extract from his book "Daughter of Zion", Jaka book, Milan, 1995, O.R. 13.05.1995:**
    > "It is also in this perspective that the particular structure of Marian dogmas must be seen, which, if this is the case, can absolutely not derive from particular texts of the New Testament." [And the dogma of the Divine Maternity?]

*   **2000 Card. Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, speech at the International Conference on the implementation of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council [The goal is to identify the Virgin Mary with the Church to minimize her, as can be seen in this text] O.R. 04.03.2000:**
    > "At first glance, the insertion of Mariology into ecclesiology, undertaken by the Council, may seem rather fortuitous. It is true that from a historical point of view, in reality, a very small majority of fathers spoke in favor of this inclusion. But from a more internal point of view, this decision corresponds perfectly to the orientation of the Constitution as a whole: it is only if this correlation has been understood that one can correctly understand the image of the Church that the Council wanted to draw. This decision is based on the research of H. Rahner, A. Müller, R. Laurentin and Karl Delahaye, thanks to whom Mariology and ecclesiology were simultaneously renewed and deepened. Hugo Rahner in particular has shown magnificently from the sources that all Mariology was conceived and established by the Fathers above all as ecclesiology: the Church is virgin and mother, she is conceived without sin and bears the weight of history, she suffers and yet she is already raised to heaven... This is already true for the woman of the Apocalypse, as she appears in chapter 12: it is not correct to limit this figure exclusively in an individualistic way to Mary, because in her is contemplated together the whole people of God, the old and the new Israel... Thus, only the chapter on Mary completes the conciliar ecclesiology and brings us back to its Christological and Trinitarian starting point."

*   **Card. Ratzinger at the Congress of Aversa, O.R. 17.09.2001:**
    > "All this is taken up and summarized once again in the last chapter of the Constitution on the Church, which deals with the Mother of the Lord. The question of whether or not to dedicate a separate chapter to her was widely debated. I think it is a good thing that the Marian element entered directly into the doctrine of the Church."
    *[The real problem was that after the apparitions of Lourdes and Fatima and the two dogmas of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception, it was expected that the 21st Ecumenical Council would make a separate document because of the importance of the Virgin, the conflict was very harsh, because it was anti-modern and an obstacle to ecumenism, in the conflict the progressives won, and Ratzinger says: "I think it's a good thing". See the box on page 9]*

*   **Pope Benedict XVI at the international congress of mariology, O.R. 09.09.2012:**
    > "At the Council, in the second session of the Council, an important group of Fathers asked that the Virgin be treated in the Constitution on the Church, while an equally important group supported the need for a specific document that would adequately highlight the privileges and the singular role of Mary in the redemption... With the vote of October 29, 1963, it was decided to opt for the first proposal... Mary... her cooperation in the divine plan of salvation and the unique mediation of Christ." [This blocks the future dogma of the Mediation of the Virgin Mary. All these bishops then no longer defended the Blessed Virgin from the entire anti-Marian Revolution led by the 5 anti-Marian popes]

*   **2005 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.12.2005 [For him it is not the Blessed Virgin who crushes the head of the serpent]:**
    > "Paul VI in his speech (said) '...We declare Mary Mother of the Church'... In fact, with this title the Pope summarized the Marian doctrine of the Council and gave the key to its understanding... In order to clarify the internal structure of the teaching on the Church developed by the Council [sic]... It is however also announced in advance that the 'offspring' of the woman will conquer and crush the head of the serpent."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the bishops of Mexico, 16.09.2005:**
    > "Stimulate your particular Churches... proposing to them a purified popular religiosity." [This is the thesis of the mixed group of Dombes, see Doc. Rév. Église no. 8]

*   **2006 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Cacciavillan, O.R. 05.08.2005 [The anti-Marian Revolution passes into the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church]:** "The struggle between the serpent, the Woman and her offspring, Jesus, who will crush the head of the serpent."

*   **2006 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 17.08.2006 [He begins to affirm that the Woman of the Apocalypse is not only the Virgin, but also the Church, the Dragon is not the devil, but the powers of violence of the world]:**
    > "She is... Blessed... because She has become the dwelling place of the Lord. The dragon is the representation of all the powers of violence of the world. The Woman... facing the dragon thus armed, this Woman who is Mary, who is the Church, appears vulnerable and defenseless."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 24.08.2006:**
    > "The Apocalypse... This Woman represents Mary, the Mother of the Redeemer, but she simultaneously represents the entire Church, the People of God, of all times, the Church of all times which with great pain, gives birth to Christ anew and always."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 12.03.2006:**
    > "By remaining Herself in the Word, she can also become the new 'Dwelling' of the Word in the world [?]... The Woman who suffers in history, the Church who is persecuted, in the end she appears as a splendid Bride, a figure of the new Jerusalem."

*   **2007-2008 Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 17.8.2007:**
    > "This dragon so strong, who wanted to devour the God made child and the Woman, the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.12.2008:**
    > "There will be a son of woman who will crush the head of the ancient serpent... Mary was the first to be freed from the original fall of our first parents." ["freed" or preserved?]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 15.09.2008:**
    > "The life and faith of the people of believers show that the grace of the Immaculate Conception made to Mary is not only a personal grace, but it is for all. It is a grace made to the entire people of God." [Are we all immaculate?]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 15.09.2008:**
    > "By enriching the Rosary with the luminous mysteries." [Did the Virgin give an impoverished Rosary?]

*   **2008 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. Gianfranco Ravasi, republishes Ratzinger's diabolical thesis. O.R 25.12.2008:** "In pagan texts, divinity almost always appears as a fertilizing, generating power... the conception of Jesus is a new reality, not a generation on the part of God... In addition to demythification there is, therefore, a dematerialization to introduce." [Ratzinger teaches this in his book "Introduction to Christianity" (Part II, 4, 2.1): "The conception of Jesus is not a procreation on the part of God... The divine sonship of Jesus does not rest, according to the faith of the Church, on the fact that Jesus had no human father... the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus would not be questioned, if Jesus had been born of a normal marriage."]

    > **Perrella, O.R. 04.06.2008:** "1854... Led to the overcoming of the traditional conception, ... Group of Dombes even the Mother of the Savior 'was marked by original sin' (no. 267)."

    > **Perrella, O.R. 04.05.2008:** "Group of Dombes... Everything in the Mother of Jesus is the fruit of grace." [So she has no merit?]

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 23.04.2009:**
    > "In the footsteps of the Fathers, who saw in the 'woman clothed with the sun' of Revelation 12:1, the image of the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.12.2009:**
    > "Rupert, moreover, takes care to insert his Mariological doctrine into the ecclesiological doctrine. ...Paul VI, ... solemnly proclaiming Mary Mother of the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI repeats that it is God and not the Virgin, who directly annihilates the serpent O.R. 15.10.2009:**
    > "It is You who vanquished the serpent, who crushed his head, when the God you bore annihilated him..."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI at the Angelus, O.R. 09.12.2009:**
    > "But a son of woman will come who will crush his head."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI at the General Audience introduces the heretical thesis of Dante, that the Virgin is more than a mere creature O.R. 22.10.2009:**
    > "Dante Alighieri, in the last canto of the 'Divine Comedy': 'humble and exalted more than a creature'."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 09.11.2009:**
    > "Paul VI... was in fact maturing an ever wider and more organic vision of the relationship between the blessed Virgin Mary and the mystery of the Church... In this context he proclaimed the Most Holy Virgin 'Mother of the Church'," [What is he trying to insinuate? See below O.R. 11.04.2009]

*   **Mgr. Gianfranco Ravasi, O.R. 11.04.2009:**
    > "Jesus thus entrusted John to take care of Mary, that is, of the Church, the people of God [This is Ratzinger's thesis, that Mary is the Church. And the people of God is the new ecumenical people of God]... there were 4 women... the fourth one only reports the parental link, she is Mary's sister and therefore Jesus' aunt." [So, for him, Saint Anne had another daughter after the Immaculate Conception?]

*   **Father Manuel Nin, in the Christmas Day Editorial O.R. 25.12.2009:**
    > "He who rides the clouds walks today on all fours... the Spirit has given a resemblance in earthworms, so generation is done without coupling... today she has dissolved her corruption by giving birth to the Savior." [He speaks of the Virgin, she was not "corrupted" by original sin]

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, when he becomes pope he denies the assumption of the Virgin's body O.R. 17.08.2010:**
    > "Mary... We all, today, are well aware that by the term 'heaven' we are not referring to any place in the universe, to a star or something similar: No." [Yes, She is in a place in the universe! Because no body can exist outside the universe]

*   **Timothy Verdon, repeats the thesis of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI on "the great Church" [O.R. 04.03.2000 and replaces the Virgin with the Church] O.R. 30.10.2010; O.R. 13.03.2009:**
    > "In the great Church, ... The woman represented at the side of Christ is certainly Mary... and also represents and above all madam the Church."

*   **Father Manuel Nin teaches that the body of the Virgin was buried [he says that the soul separated from the body and that the body was buried] O.R. 15.08.2010:**
    > "John came to bury the body... buried her body. The rank of the Apostles accompanied the resplendent soul of her who is the Mother of the Son of God... Adoration to the Son who for the burial of his Mother gathered prophets, apostles and patriarchs."

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI, the Woman of the Apocalypse is the Church 09.12.2011:**
    > "The Apocalypse... represents at the same time the Blessed Virgin and the Church... On the head of the Woman clothed with the sun there is a crown of twelve stars. This sign represents the twelve tribes of Israel... It introduces us to the second great interpretation of the celestial sign of the 'Woman clothed with the sun': besides representing the Virgin, this sign personifies the Church, therefore the Dragon; vanquished once and for all in heaven, he turns his attacks against the Woman: the Church."

*   **2011 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Father Manuel Nin, citing heretical authors without criticizing them, continues to teach the theory of the burial of the Blessed Virgin. Editorial of L'O.R. 14.8.2011:** "Six homilies are dedicated to the Mother of God, including one on her death and burial...: 'Grant me to sing of the burial of her who was faithful... The choir of the twelve chosen Apostles, who buried the body of the ever-blessed Virgin... They laid the body of the Mother of God in the hollow of the rocky sepulcher... God also, with the angels, buried Mary on the Mount of Olives, the Master buried his Mother.'"

    > **Card. Ravasi on the last book of Benedict XVI, O.R. 25.3.2011:** "The true summit is in the resurrection and ascension, where an unprecedented horizon opens up... 'The ascension is not the act of going away to a place far from the cosmos, but a permanent proximity.'" [He repeats and propagates the heretical thesis of Benedict XVI (O.R. 17.08.2010), that the body of the Virgin is not found in any place in the universe, see above].

    > **Osservatore Romano, 11.2.2011:** "A document to be discussed that the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion will appreciate... 'Seattle Declaration'... The Catholic Dogma of the Immaculate and the Assumption... 'The members of ARCIC have sought to mutually penetrate each other in the way of doing theology... It invites each of our communities to move away from static historical positions.'"

    > **Thimoty Verdon, at the school of Ratzinger who said; "The conception of Jesus is not a generation by God" ("Introduction to Christianity" (Part II, 4, 2.1)) here is another way of denying the Incarnation. O.R. 21.12.2011:** "Giotto... Even if he anticipates the humanist way of representing the Virgin, the patristic idea which considers the Incarnation as an internal event even before being physical [?] is alive in his painting... The incarnation of the Word is above all an internal event, more mental than physical." [After denying that the body of the Virgin is in the universe, now the Incarnation is presented as an "internal and mental" event.]

    > **Father Manuel Nin uses apocryphal gospels (false gospels) without criticism, O.R. 20.11.2011:** "The Protoevangelium of James, an apocryphal... Mary nourished by the Archangel Gabriel... The Christ... who before the ages was immutably begotten by the Father, was, in the last times, in the Virgin, without seed." ["without the seed" of Saint Joseph, says the Council of Trent, because the Holy Spirit created from nothing, as for Adam, all that is necessary for Jesus Christ to be man, because from the Virgin alone a man cannot be born: it is the miraculous fertilization of the Virgin prophesied by Isaiah 7:14, and denied by the rationalists, of whom even Ratzinger himself is ashamed and changes the incarnation because it "is a punch in the eyes" for the rationalists, "Introduction to Christianity" (see part II, 4, 2.1)]

    > **Salvatore Perrella. O.R. 08.12.2011:** "The Virgin Mary is holy... By pure grace... gift and fruit of pure grace... De Lubac... Far from wanting to return to a kind of anthropological Manichaeism or a widespread split between nature and the supernatural."

    > **Osservatore Romano, "Ecumenical Publisher", 09.05.2011:** "Mary, but not without Israel. A new vision of the dogma on the Immaculate Conception."

    > **Documentation of how, at the Second Vatican Council, despite the two recent dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, and the two great apparitions of Lourdes and Fatima, the 21st ecumenical council, instead of making an exclusive text on the Virgin, under the pretext of ecumenism with the Protestants, reduced everything to a chapter of "Lumen Gentium":**
    >
    > "On September 16, 1964, the preparatory schema on the Virgin Mary became a modest Chapter VIII of the constitution 'Lumen gentium'. Moreover, this chapter is mutilated and the title of 'Mother of the Church' has been omitted. Thirty-three fathers take the floor and many protest against these modifications. Card. Ruffini, archbishop of Palermo, accuses the text of tarnishing Mary's cooperation in the work of the Redemption; he also asks that the term 'Mediatrix' be explained.
    >
    > Mgr Mingo, archbishop of Monreale in Sicily proposes that the term be specified by 'Mediatrix of all graces' and protests against the suppression of the title 'Mother of the Church'. Card. Wyszynski, archbishop of Warsaw, on behalf of 70 Polish bishops, asks that Mary be proclaimed 'Mother of the Church' and proposes that the text become a complete schema again.
    >
    > Curiously, even Card. Suenens supports these interventions, despite their opposition to the position of the European Alliance. He reproaches the text for minimizing the importance of the Blessed Virgin. Far from being discouraged, the Alliance reacts to defend its project.
    >
    > Card. Leger (Quebec) argues that 'abuses of Marian cult must be firmly repressed', he denounces the 'verbal inflation' of Marian theology, adding that it should not be 'confused with depth of thought'.
    >
    > Card. Döpfner, on behalf of the 90 German-speaking and Nordic bishops, affirms that the text, as it is, is perfect.
    >
    > Card. Bea, for his part, explains that the title of 'mediatrix' should be suppressed because a conciliar text 'is not a manual of private devotion' especially since, he adds, 'the role of Mary as mediatrix is not theologically certain.'"

*   **2012 Pope Benedict XVI on the occasion of the Assumption, O.R. 17.08.2012:**
    > "Mary... does not go to an unknown galaxy." [He reiterates his thesis from O.R. 17.08.2010: "The body of the Virgin is not found in any place in the universe."]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI repeats the thesis of Dombes, according to which the Virgin is not Queen, but "our sister and humble servant", O.R. 23.08.2012:**
    > "What does Mary Queen mean?... The kingship of Jesus [and of Mary] has nothing to do with that of the powerful of the earth... In helping us in all our needs; she is our sister and humble servant."

    *[Pius XII 01.11.1950: "We define as a dogma... that Mary... was assumed... in body and soul... If therefore anyone doubts, let him know that he has failed in the divine and Catholic faith."]*

*   **Pope Benedict XVI at the international congress of mariology, O.R. 09.09.2012:**
    > "At the Council, in the second session of the Council, an important group of Fathers asked that the Virgin be treated in the Constitution on the Church, while an equally important group supported the need for a specific document that would adequately highlight the privileges and the singular role of Mary in the redemption... With the vote of October 29, 1963, it was decided to opt for the first proposal... Mary... her cooperation in the divine plan of salvation and the unique mediation of Christ." [See the text of "Una Vox" cited on page 9. This blocks the future dogma of the Mediation of the Virgin Mary.]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 02.01.2012:**
    > "The mystery of her Divine Maternity, which we celebrate today, contains in superabundance that gift of grace that every human maternity carries within it [so the divine maternity is only something 'superabundant' compared to 'every human maternity']... the Church also participates in the mystery of the divine maternity." [The Incarnation is therefore not something exclusive]

*   **2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Angelo Amato, O.R. 05.09.2012:** "A scientific mariology... the innovative discourse of Vatican II... the magisterium of John Paul II was exceptional... his cycle of Marian catechesis (1995-1997)... Pope Wojtyla revisited entirely the magisterium of Mary." [We have published our own book "The anti-Marian revolution" on this subject, you can find it on our website]

    > **Father Manuel Nin, for the feast of the Immaculate Conception, in the editorial, uses blasphemous images. O.R. 08.12.2012:** "At the center of the whole text is Christ, the fatted calf immolated [it is not the lamb] who spreads... So Mary, whose conception we celebrate, is the heifer ('giovenca'), the instrument that God used to give the world the Savior."

    > **Giorgio Allessandrini now applies the thesis of the new theology of Benedict XVI (O.R. 09.12.2011), according to which the Woman of the Apocalypse is the Church, O.R. 30.12.2012:** "Chapter XI of the Apocalypse... here, as a symbol of the Church, holy and persecuted, appears the Woman clothed with the sun groaning in the pains of childbirth which is prolonged in time."

    > **Father Manuel Nin says that Eve is the Blessed Virgin, O.R. 23.12.2012:** "This same typology is found in the figures of Eve and Mary... The serpent has been annihilated: indeed, she whom he had once deceived, he now saw become the Mother of the Creator." [The serpent 'had once deceived' her, who? the Most Holy Virgin? Or did Eve become the mother of God?]

    > **Inos Biffi, O.R. 16.12.2012:** "Besides, what began to surprise in Nazareth was not the fact that He was the son of the carpenter, nor the fact that He had brothers and sisters." [Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI the virginity of Mary is denied. See also the article below by Alain Besançon, in the book on the infancy of Jesus, Benedict XVI does not take a position on the question of the 'brothers of Jesus' editorial, O.R. 23.01.2013]

    > **Inos Biffi O.R. 08.12.2012:** "Mary is not above the Church." It is not a question of being above the Church, but what makes her the greatest after the Holy Trinity is, as Pius XII says, 09.08.1953: "As Saint Thomas Aquinas declares, 'The Blessed Virgin Mary, from the fact that she is the Mother of God, possesses a dignity that is in some way infinite'."]

*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI.**
    *Before Benedict XVI resigned and declared the see vacant from 28.02.2013 until a new election, these articles are still published under his pontificate.*
    > **Mgr. Gerhard Ludwig Muller, O.R. 19.01.2013:** "The Incarnation of the Word, the conception of Jesus as man, by the operation of the Holy Spirit, is neither a myth, nor a biological rarity, but a historical reality." [He says two truths "by the operation of the Holy Spirit" and "historical reality" and in the middle he puts a blasphemy; it is not "a biological rarity". The conception of Jesus is biologically miraculous, not only rare, but unique. The blessed Pope Pius IX, on 26.08.1852 says, that in the House which is now in Loreto, the Virgin was "fertilized by the Holy Spirit".]

    > **Alain Besançon [In the book on the infancy of Jesus, Benedict XVI does not take a position on the question of the 'brothers of Jesus'], editorial, O.R. 23.01.2013:** "From the expression 'Brothers of Jesus'... one could expect... that the pope [Benedict XVI] would declare with authority that according to all theological evidence, such a supposition is unthinkable, but the pope did not do so." [Benedict XVI was careful to emphasize that he did not take a position on the question of the 'brothers of Jesus'. And if the matter had not been understood, to leave no doubt before becoming 'pope emeritus', he had it emphasized by his theologians in the Osservatore Romano. He thus also denies the dogma of the virginity of the Mother of God. If someone has not yet understood this, he takes the trouble to convince them.]

    > **Timothy Verdon, Benedict XVI insinuates with his theologians that Jesus 'learns', if he learns it means he is not God, that is, the incarnate Wisdom. O.R. 04.01.2013:** "The God of Love wanted to learn the gestures of human love from Mary, he trusted in her affection [St Thomas teaches that the Word already knew everything but accepts that he be taught what He already knows]... In the field of lay spirituality of Northern Europe, Mary would have had two half-sisters, born of St. Anne after the death of Joachim, from two successive husbands... The extended Holy Family... With other children and other husbands."

## False restoration

### In general

*   **1985 What is the false restoration that Card. Ratzinger makes known with the book "The Ratzinger Report"?** It is an intermediate line between the progressives and the traditionalists, with the aim of recovering traditionalist Catholics and preventing moderate Catholics, frightened by progressivism, from going with Mgr. Lefebvre, and this by also creating congregations that celebrate the mass of St. Pius V but who accept the liberalism of Vatican II such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Good Shepherd Institute, the Institute of Christ the King, etc.

> **Cardinal Ratzinger declares: "Restoration? Yes, if it means a new balance... if by restoration one means to go back, then no restoration is possible."**

*   The cardinal himself affirms that a restoration is taking place. We may be on the eve of a large-scale operation, no less important than Vatican II, and which will continue even after his death. This is the worldly political method to legitimize "centrism" against the opposing extremisms of right and left, but it is not the supernatural logic of truth. This method will continue for many years. Card. Ratzinger says: "In this sense, one can say that the first phase after Vatican II is over..." (The Ratzinger Report, p. 36).

*   **Card. Ratzinger declares it officially and with authority in the famous interview with the Italian magazine Jesus (Nov. 1984) published with the note: "Text approved by H.E. Card. Ratzinger on October 1"; one of the subtitles even says:**
    > "Restoration? Yes, if it means a new balance... if by restoration one means to go back, then no restoration is possible: the Church advances towards the fulfillment of history, its eyes fixed forward on the Lord. But if by 'restoration' one means the search for a new balance, after the exaggerations of an opening to the world without discrimination, after the too positive interpretations of an agnostic and atheistic world, then yes, this 'restoration' is desirable, it is moreover already at work... ...Yes, the problem of the Sixties was to acquire the better expressed values of two centuries of liberal culture. [“liberty, equality, fraternity”, Mgr. Lefebvre had warned us: "There were three time bombs in the Council, liberty, equality, fraternity". ("An Bishop Speaks")] These are in fact values which, even if they were born outside the Church, can find their place - purified and corrected - in its vision of the world. This is what was done."

*   **2005 Pope Benedict XVI to the bishops and cardinals of the Curia, this is a text from 2005, which we highlight several times in this magazine, because here he also theorizes the false Restoration. The whole text is very important. O.R. 23.12.2005:**
    > "Council... The problems of reception arose from the fact that two contrary hermeneutics were confronted and disputed with each other. One caused confusion, the other, silently, but ever more visibly has borne and bears fruit [The 'fruits' are to have made various traditionalist personalities and communities fall into error: Mgr Rifan, the abbots Aulagnier, Laguérie,.. and it continues]. On the one hand there is an interpretation that I would like to call 'hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture'; ... On the other hand there is the 'hermeneutic of reform' of renewal in continuity... This is a subject that grows in time and develops... The seed however grows... One realized that the American revolution had offered a model of state different from that theorized by the radical trends that emerged in the second phase of the French Revolution... Catholic statesmen had demonstrated that a modern secular state could exist, which is not however neutral with regard to values, but which lives by drawing from the great ethical sources, opened by Christianity. Catholic social doctrine, which is constantly developing, had become an important model between radical liberalism and the Marxist theory of the state... One could say that three circles of questions had formed, ... between faith and the modern sciences... Secondly... the relationship between the Church and the modern state... thirdly... the relationship between the Christian faith and the religions of the world... [And Pope Ratzinger concludes with the false restoration]: Between the Church and the faith of Israel... It is precisely in this set of continuity and discontinuity on several levels that the nature of the true reform consists... thus the fundamental decisions remain valid... the Second Vatican Council, by recognizing and making its own, with the Decree on religious freedom, an essential principle of the modern state, recovered the deepest heritage of the Church [sic].... It clearly rejected the state religion. The martyrs... also died for freedom of conscience." [martyrs for freemasonry...]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, Message for the World Day of Peace, O.R. 14.12.2005:**
    > "Nihilists deny the existence of all truth; fundamentalists claim to impose it by force."

*   **2005 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Archbishop Frank Rode, O.R. 26.6.2005:** "There are two dangers: nostalgia for the golden age of Christian Europe, which corresponds to a romantic vision of the Middle Ages... and secular fundamentalism... The European identity that Card. Ratzinger punctually indicates in the book written with the President of the Italian Senate Marcello Pera."

    > **Card. Angelo Sodano, O.R. 3.12.2005:** "The Priestly Ministry between tradition and modernity... Several have pointed out that an absolute traditionalism is reprehensible... But at the same time a radical modernism has been justly condemned."

    > **Mgr. Amédée Grab at the Synod O.R. 9.10.2005:** "Avoid two opposite dangers: prejudicial closures and relativism."

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI, himself, in the Apostolic Letter "Motu Proprio datæ" declares that the cause of the "rift" is not the Mass of Saint Pius V but "deeper roots" [Mgr. Lefebvre calls them: "the three time bombs": religious freedom, collegiality and ecumenism.] And affirms "the binding nature... of the Second Vatican Council":**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 08.07.2007:** "The last edition of the Missale Romanum... of 1962... may, on the contrary, be used as an extraordinary form... Mgr Lefebvre, fidelity to the old Missal has become its external symbol; but the reasons for this rift have deeper roots [Here we agree with Benedict XVI]. ... Many people who clearly accepted the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council... also wished to rediscover the form of the Holy Liturgy to which they were attached... The holiness of the new rite." [This is Card. Ratzinger's thesis: "To make the Lefebvre schism superfluous", "Concilium", Chile, 1988]

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R.14.09.2008:**
    > "Facing the poles of subjective free will and fundamentalist fanaticism of the other."

*   **Benedict XVI on the O.R. teaches that it was Protestantism that inspired the Church of Vatican II, and affirms that Newman's vision of the Church derives from his Protestantism. Newman invented the middle way between Catholicism and Protestantism. This is one of Ratzinger's fundamental theses in his book "The Ratzinger Report", ch. II, "Two opposite errors", 1985. We call it the false Restoration.**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 19.09.2010:** "In the person of John Henry Newman, whose ecclesial vision was nourished by his Anglican origin... He can teach us the virtues that ecumenism requires... He was moved, because pushed by his conscience. [the Protestant free interpretation]".

*   **Pope Benedict XVI at Fatima O.R. 13.05.2010:**
    > "The Church, starting from a renewed conscience [?] of the Catholic tradition, takes seriously and discerns, transfigures and surpasses the criticisms that are at the basis of the forces that have characterized modernity, that is to say the Reformation and the Enlightenment. Thus the Church herself welcomed and recreated the best of the instances of modernity,... a new civilization, the 'civilization of love'."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 11.03.2010:**
    > "And, thank God, the wise helmsmen of the barque of Peter, Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II, have, on the one hand, defended the newness of the Council and at the same time, on the other, defended the uniqueness and continuity of the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 27.8.2010: the middle line between truth and modern errors: "purified and corrected"**
    *L'Osservatore Romano republishes a writing of Card. Ratzinger: O.R. 22.11.2010:*
    > "The reconciliation between the modern era and faith, which was, in a certain way, the master idea of Vatican II... Some thought that now again one could not remain behind the new spirit... there were others, who, on the contrary, declared that the very orientation of the Council was a failure."

    *[Those who do not know the errors of the modern world and the errors of the Revolution can obviously not understand the errors of Benedict XVI and obviously accept his idea of drawing a middle line between truth and error "purified". On the other hand, those who know modern errors and study Benedict XVI understand that it is not a question of "purified" principles because these are precisely the liberal and Masonic ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity based on the subjectivism of conscience and not on objective truth.]*

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 03.01.2011:**
    > "We are witnessing two extreme opposite tendencies, both negative: on the one hand secularism which, in a devious way marginalizes religion to confine it to the private sphere, on the other hand fundamentalism which, for its part, would like to impose it by force."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 22.10.2011:**
    > "Neither confessional, nor pragmatic."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 05.05.2011:**
    > "Aware of the developments in culture and society, the Second Vatican Council proposed a new anthropological foundation for religious freedom." ["A new foundation"... here it is the hermeneutic of rupture with the previous teaching].

*   **2012 Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 12.10.2012:**
    > "The authentic spirit of Vatican II... through its documents, protects from extremes, both from anachronistic nostalgias and from leaps forward; it allows us to grasp newness in continuity. [Here Benedict XVI reaffirms the fundamental thesis of his pontificate: the middle line between the traditional Magisterium and progressivism]. The Council, in matters of faith, did not imagine anything new and did not want to replace what is old."
    *[This is an explicit lie because the doctrine on justification, freedom of conscience, ecumenism, etc... These are all new doctrines, and in many articles they openly glorify these new doctrines contrary to the irreformable Magisterium.]*

*   **2008 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Ruini O.R. 09.01.2008:** "Benedict XVI, indicating the royal road to overcoming the counter-opposition of two hermeneutics... a hermeneutic of rupture... and a hermeneutic of reform in continuity... In the latter there is no opposition between the Gospel and modernity... by overcoming the counter-opposition between anthropocentrism and theocentrism."

    > **Mgr. Angelo Amato, O.R. 27.02.2008:** "Benedict XVI... On the one hand he faced the many challenges of erroneous ideologies... on the other he promoted enlightening orientations..."

    > **Card. Angelo Scola, O.R. 28.4.2008:** "Roncalli... neither conservative nor progressive."

    > **Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 17.09.2011:** "Two fronts: on the one hand, by the 'confessionalism of division' which relies on what is specific precisely where its specificity is opposed to that of others and, on the other hand, by 'indifference on matters of faith'."

    > **Card. Kurt Koch confirms that "the old liturgy" and "Summorum pontificum" serve to make the Revolution in the Church more credible. O.R. 15.05.2011:** "But this presupposes that the old liturgy is understood as an 'ecumenical bridge'. ...And the old liturgy will not be able to fulfill its ecumenical function as a bridge-builder... Benedict XVI indeed knows well that, in the long term, we will not be able to stop at a coexistence between the ordinary form and the extraordinary form of the Roman rite, but that the Church will again need a common rite in the future." [And they tell you: "but the Church will again need a common rite in the future." It is for this reason that Francis, obeying the wisdom of Benedict XVI, who "knows well", suppressed the traditional Mass.]

    > **Osservatore Romano, 01.04.2011:** "Towards a new edition of the Roman Missal."

*   **Benedict XVI, during his pontificate, had his overly conservative image corrected by Paolo Portoghesi, and confirms that he is a false restorer and a true progressive.**
    > **Paolo Portoghesi O.R. 05.11.2011:** "Benedict XVI and modernity... The portrait of the Pope... turned towards the past, given to a hypothesis of 'reconquest' or a nostalgic return to the past is totally to be excluded, and is moreover denied by the facts. For who knows his theological and philosophical work as well as his pastoral action, ... his gentle but firm will for innovation." [How true this sentence is! For those who cannot or will not understand, and they explain it themselves. In fact, how many traditionalists have read and understood the writings of Benedict XVI?]


### Benedict XVI tries to recover the Society of Saint Pius X

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI, himself, in the Apostolic Letter "Motu Proprio datæ" declares that the cause of the "rift" is not the Mass of St. Pius V but "deeper roots": Mgr Lefebvre calls them: "the three bombs": religious freedom, collegiality and ecumenism. Benedict XVI affirms "the binding nature... of the Second Vatican Council".**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 08.07.2007:** "It is feared first of all that the Authority [sic] of the Second Vatican Council is being undermined and that one of its essential decisions – the liturgical reform – is being called into question. This fear is unfounded... The last edition of the Missale Romanum... of 1962... may, on the contrary, be used as an extraordinary form of the liturgical celebration. It is not appropriate to speak of these two editions of the Roman Missal as if they were 'two rites'. It is rather a dual use of the one and same rite. We all know that, in the movement led by Archbishop Mgr Lefebvre, fidelity to the old Missal has become its external symbol; but the reasons for this rift have deeper roots [We agree with Benedict XVI that it is not about the issue of the Mass]. Many people who clearly accepted the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council [sic... Benedict XVI tells us that it is no longer a pastoral council but "binding"] and who were faithful to the Pope and the Bishops, also wished to rediscover the form of the Holy Liturgy to which they were attached [for archaeologism]... The Pope thus wanted to help especially the Society of Saint Pius X to find full unity with the successor of Peter... It is a matter of achieving an internal reconciliation within the Church. [This is Card. Ratzinger's thesis: "To make the Lefebvre schism superfluous" Chile, "Concilium", 1988]. Naturally, to live in full communion, the priests of the Communities that adhere to the ancient use cannot, in principle, exclude the celebration according to the new books. This would indeed not be consistent with the recognition of the value and holiness of the new rite by the total exclusion of this same rite."

*   **2009 The revocation of the excommunication and the demand for acceptance of the doctrine of Vatican II and the conciliar popes: "true and faithful recognition of the Magisterium, of the Pope and of the Second Vatican Council."**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 29.01.2009:** "I hope that my gesture will be followed by a prompt commitment on their part, to take the necessary further steps to achieve full communion with the Church, thus testifying to a true and faithful recognition of the Magisterium, of the Pope and of the Second Vatican Council."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, in order to recover the Society of Saint Pius X, had lifted the excommunication of the four bishops of this same Society but not that of His Excellency Mgr. Lefebvre and H.E. Mgr. De Castro Mayer. But after Mgr. Williamson's interview on Holocaust denial, and under pressure from indignant Jews, he was forced to back down, remove his mask and thus miss his trap to the point that the Osservatore Romano itself declared: "A bad scenario has been staged" (26.01.2009). After all this, Benedict XVI made a new adjustment to the situation:**
    1.  He asks the Fraternity for doctrinal consent.
    2.  He repeats that this is an operation of "recovery" [This had already been declared in 1988, during the consecrations of the bishops, without papal authorization, to recover the traditionalist priests who did not agree with Mgr Lefebvre. See *30 Giorni*, October 1988: "The recovery operation continues". But "despite the aggressive 'recovery operation' well conducted and implemented by the Vatican authorities, the traditionalist army of Mgr Lefebvre is far from being defeated and retreating, as many believe today" (*Il Sabato*, July 8, 1989)].
    3.  He asks that the "recovered" priests change their traditional spirit to the modernist one.
    4.  He explicitly states that one must enter the "Great Church" (Card. Ratzinger, O.R. 04.03.2000), so it is not the Roman Church.

    > **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 13.03.2009:** "Some groups, on the other hand, openly accused the Pope of wanting to go back, before the Council... A step back from all the steps of reconciliation that have been made since the Council between Christians and Jews, these steps whose promotion and sharing have been, from the beginning, the personal objective of my theological work... For this very reason I thank all the more the Jewish friends who helped to promptly clear up the misunderstanding... It is necessary to distinguish the disciplinary level from the doctrinal domain. The fact that the Society of St. Pius X does not have a canonical situation in the Church is not based on disciplinary reasons but on doctrinal ones: [1st affirmation]... To clarify it once more: as long as the doctrinal questions are not clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church: [2nd affirmation]... The problems that will have to be dealt with are essentially of a doctrinal nature: [3rd affirmation] and concern above all the acceptance of the Second Vatican Council and the post-conciliar Magisterium of the Popes... One cannot freeze the magisterial authority of the Church at the year 1962, this must be very clear to the Society, [Now it's clear. Thank you], from this follows as a logical consequence that we must have at heart the unity of believers... for ecumenism... to make room for what is positive and recoverable... I myself have seen how, in the years 1988, through the return of communities that were separated from Rome, their internal climate changed [Even the Pope tells you that you have changed. Wake up!], how the return to the great and broad common Church allowed to overcome unilateral positions and to soften rigidities... for a long time, but again on this occasion, we have heard from some representatives of this community [the Society] many false notes, pedantry, fixations on unilateralisms, etc... But should not the Great Church also allow itself to be generous, conscious of its long breath?" [So they will not enter the Roman Church, but the current "Great Church"].

    > **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.07.2009:** "As long as they are not clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church and its members cannot legitimately exercise any ministry... precisely because the problems that must be dealt with with the Society are of an essentially doctrinal nature."

*   **2009 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Bertone at the "Circle of Rome" tries to explain the situation, O.R. 30.01.2009:** "Strengthened by fidelity to Vatican II... this Pontiff is above all a servant of unity. Constantly striving for reconciliation within the Catholic Church as well as for ecumenism... The very recent gesture towards the disciples of Mgr Lefebvre, this is the key to understanding [Thank you, Mr. Cardinal, for explaining it so clearly to us]."

    > **Regarding the denialism of H.E. Mgr Williamson, Carlo di Chicco, sub-director in the O.R. 26.01.2009, says:** "An erroneous scenario was staged."

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, to make the introduction of Protestants into the Church more easily accepted, wished to accept the Society of Saint Pius X with the Anglicans, and finally only the Anglicans were accepted. O.R. 16.1.2010:**
    > "The commitment of the Dicastery to overcome the doctrinal problems... of the Society of St. Pius X... and for the full integration of the faithful who belong to Anglicanism."

*   **2010 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Levada, reiterates the thesis of Benedict XVI O.R. 01.01.2010:** "To clarify and eventually overcome the doctrinal problems... of the Society of St. Pius X and for the full integration of the faithful who belong to Anglicanism."

    > **Anna Foa, a warning for the Society of St. Pius X, O.R. 18.01.2010:** "The conciliar doctrine, said the Pope, represents a firm point for Catholics. A declaration that should, in itself, sweep away any concern for an unimaginable rapprochement of the Church with those who do not want to accept the Second Vatican Council."

    > **Lucetta Scaraffia O.R. 18.1.2010:** "The importance of Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the Jewish Community of Rome is comparable to no other visit... Beyond... the infamous statements of a Lefebvrist bishop... Ratzinger in fact... one of the main protagonists of this current of study that has placed the relationship with Judaism at the center of theological research."

*   **2012 Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 08.11.2012:**
    > "In the multiple discussions about the possibility of a readmission of the Priestly Society of St. Pius X into the Church, facing the Jews, the Holy Father charged me with presenting the question correctly... a rapprochement of the Priestly Society of St. Pius X in no way means that the positions of the said Society are accepted or supported... From the beginning of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI has however left no doubt about the fact that he fully subscribes to the Second Vatican Council and its documents, in its necessary overall vision... The accusation of 'deicide' which unfortunately was directed wholesale against the Jews in various places over the centuries is also dismissed... Israel... a state that perceives itself decidedly as Jewish." [So the "positive, healthy, authentic, etc... secularism" of Benedict XVI is valid only for the Catholic Church]

#ä# Even Benedict XVI is for the hermeneutic of rupture with the traditional Magisterium

> **This is the Revolution in the Church, only the Counter-revolution can understand and eliminate these errors**

*   **2011 Osservatore Romano, 24.02.2011:**
    > "With Benedict XVI the tiara disappeared from the official coat of arms of the Pontiff, and the bridges that cross the river of Rome are, today, safer and wider."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the German Parliament, O.R. 24.09.2011:**
    > "For the development of law... it was decisive that Christian theologians took a position against religious law, claimed by faith in divinities, that they placed themselves on the side of philosophy, recognizing as a valid legal source for all reason and nature in their correlation."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 28.10.2011:**
    > "Even in the name of the Christian faith, violence has been used. We recognize this with great shame. It is the task of all those who have any responsibility for the Christian faith to purify the religion of Christians." [Here too it is the hermeneutic of rupture and not of continuity]. A reminder to us believers, to all believers to purify their own faith." [All religions must be rationalized and secularized]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI on the importance of the liturgical Revolution, O.R. 07.05.2011:**
    > "Fifty years of liturgical formation... with the aim of renewing the mentality... The liturgy... the great educator... A constant and correct relationship between *sana traditio* and *legitima progressio*... the liturgy renews the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict, O.R. 30.06.2011:**
    > "The end of temporal power, subsequently felt as providential."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 27.03.2011:**
    > "Court of the Gentiles... a just secularism... by overcoming convictions."

*   **2011 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Osservatore Romano 01.12.2011:** "Pope Benedict XVI encouraged... to abolish the death penalty."

    > **Card Kurt Koch, O.R. 17.09.2011:** "For Benedict XVI, ... a 'confessionalism of division', which focuses on what is specific precisely where this specificity is opposed to that of others." [We are told that we must no longer consider the truths that divide, but the popes before Vatican II denounced precisely these errors, to preserve the virginity of the faith]

    > **Fernando Ocáriz, Vicar General of Opus Dei, O.R. 2.12.2011:** "The Second Vatican Council must not only be interpreted in the light of previous magisterial documents, but some of the latter are also better understood in the light of Vatican II." [This is the Magisterium upside down]

*   **Mgr. Briann Farrel, O.R. 19.1.2011:**
    > "It seems to me almost a miracle that more than 2000 bishops, who came to Rome to begin the Council in 1962, and many of them formed in a theology of 'exclusion', according to which Orthodox and Protestants, schismatics and heretics, in the terminology in use at the time, were simply outside the Church, were able to produce, three years later, the decree 'Unitatis redintegratio', ...John XXIII spoke of a 'Leap forward'... The texts of this year were prepared in Jerusalem." [It is not a miracle, the bishops were imbued with modernism for a long time, moreover Saint Pius X since his pontificate officially denounced the infiltration of modernism]

*   **Card. Kasper, O.R. 27.01.2012:**
    > "Already during the Second Vatican Council two factions had formed which were soon called respectively 'conservative' and 'progressive', ...In the meantime Benedict XVI has given an important impetus to the conciliar hermeneutic. ... in renewal, the hermeneutic of the Second Vatican Council must start from the idea of development of the great masters of the school of Tübingen and the doctrine of development of John Henry Newman."

*   **2012 Card. Angelo Scola against fundamentalists, O.R. 15.11.2012:**
    > "Will it be possible to assert, with all, this principle of communication which will allow the legislator, if it proves necessary, to also adopt repressive measures, ... Among these deviations are also... fundamentalism... anti-modern tendencies that would call into question the undoubted acquisitions of modernity."

*   **Card. Ravasi, O.R. 23.06.2012:**
    > "Between the extremes of superficiality and fanaticism, there are those who transform faith into a banner that flies in the midst of storms, ... they raise it to the top of the palace of politics, thus creating theocracies and sacralized regimes, imposing the reading of faith through a fundamentalism... In the middle of these two extremes..."

*   **Giovanni Maria Vian, director of L'Osservatore Romano, in the editorial corrects the image of a restorer Benedict XVI, 12.10.2012:**
    > "Pope Ratzinger is not the gravedigger of Vatican II... just as his documents are a firm reference 'sheltered from extremes, both from anachronistic nostalgias and from leaps forward', as he himself recalled."

*   **Lucetta Scaraffia in the editorial, continues to affirm that there is a new method of Benedict XVI (the false restoration), which is not yet understood, O.R. 04.01.2012:**
    > "Too often Benedict XVI is not read in his originality and newness... Why must everything he says necessarily fit into the old schemes of progressive or conservative... will it take historians 100 years to understand it?" [So, neither progressive, nor conservative.]

*   **Lucetta Scaraffia, in this very important editorial article, under the pontificate of Benedict XVI highlights the change of doctrine, 15.06.2012:**
    > "The Popes of the 19th century condemned the Declaration (of 1789 on human rights)... Catholic positions in favor of human rights, the most striking of which was certainly that of Jacques Maritain, multiplied during and after the Second World War... but the real obstacle to total acceptance by the Church is freedom of conscience, which will only be welcomed by John XXIII in his encyclical 'Pacem in terris' of 1963." [Finally they admit what the 'prince' of Vaticanists, Zizola, had already said: "no pope has reached the charism of John XXIII"]

*   **Osservatore Romano, O.R. 01.01.2012:**
    > "In reality the Council... if one thinks of the rich Tradition of which it is the guardian, but also of the 'discontinuity', for having welcomed the instances of modernity."

*   **Agostino Marchetto makes an explicit apology for the middle way between progressivism and Tradition, this is the false restoration, but: "the right middle has not yet been found" and, O.R. 02.02.2012:**
    > "Ten years after the Council the Christian faith finds itself torn between its reduction to an earthly messianism and a new integrism; the right middle has not yet been found. Ratzinger... in 1985 notes that: 'The conciliar interpretations, whether from the right or the left, highlight the character of rupture of the Council, either to reject it, or to radicalize the renewal'. There is, on the contrary, a continuity that allows neither backward movement, nor forward flight, nor anachronistic nostalgias, nor unjustified impatience."

*   **Giovanni Maria Vian, director of L'Osservatore Romano, 06.04.2012:**
    > "'The way to follow is neither disobedience nor stiffening. Benedict XVI has historicized his response.'"

### Benedict XVI makes a very important summary of his pontificate

*After announcing his resignation on February 11, 2013 and before the election of Pope Francis on March 13, 2013, Benedict XVI gave a speech to the Curia that seemed to be his testament. There is a synthesis of the Revolution in the Church made by Vatican II, by his pontificate, and of his false restoration to recover the traditionalists, he explains it himself for those who have not yet understood.*

**Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 16.02.2013:** "The prepared texts... cardinals Liénart and Frings had said publicly: 'not like that'. We want to make our own lists and elect our own candidates... It was already an experience of the universality of the Church [democracy in the Church] and of the concrete reality of the Church, which does not simply receive injunctions from above [from papal authority. They chose to do as the Protestants do]... The most prepared, let's say those who had better defined intentions, were the French, German, Belgian and Dutch episcopates, the so-called 'Rhine alliance' [cf. the book: 'The Rhine flows into the Tiber', by Wiltgen]... It was they who showed the way... The first of the reforms... was the liturgical one... the second ecclesiology; the third the word of God, Revelation [The primacy of Scripture over the magisterium, [see here Chap. X and his 'theology of encyclicals' in 'The new people of God' (Part II chap.3, a)], and finally also ecumenism... Let's start with the first. The liturgical movement, a rediscovery of the richness and depth of the liturgy... The second theme, the Church... The doctrine on the primacy... for a complete ecclesiology... Romano Guardini said: 'The Church is beginning to awaken in souls'... We are the Church... We must complete the ecclesiology in a theological way, while also pursuing it in a structural way... and to do so we found the word 'collegiality'... The Body of the Apostles, the Body of Bishops, is the continuity of the Body of the Twelve... The Body of the Church, with the bishops successors of the Apostles, as carrying elements... In the fifties, we were already beginning to criticize the concept of 'Mystical Body' of Christ. This term would be too spiritual, too exclusive; at that time, we began to put forward the concept of 'People of God'... a concept that implies the continuity of the Testaments... But it was only after the Council that an element was brought to light, which in the Council itself remained a little hidden, that is: the link between 'People of God' and 'Body of Christ'. It is truly communion with Christ in the Eucharistic union. Here we become the Body of Christ; that is to say that the relationship between People of God and Body of Christ creates a new reality: communion... the Council led to this concept... communion as a central conception. [This is Ratzinger's theory that whoever has a valid Eucharist is part of the Church]. The problem of Revelation was even more conflictual. It was here about the relationship between Scripture and Tradition... Compared to the Protestants, who were making great discoveries, the Catholics felt a little handicapped by the need to submit to the Magisterium. [For us, it is our glory, but for Ratzinger it is a handicap]... Tradition is not above Scripture... And finally ecumenism... Concerning these themes, the 'Rhine alliance' had, so to speak, done its work. [He can affirm this since he was part of it]... Religious freedom,... America, the United States, were very interested in religious freedom. In the third period of the Council they said to the pope: We cannot go home without taking with us in our luggage a declaration on religious freedom voted by the council... The great document 'Gaudium et spes'... 'Nostra ætate' and a more synthetic and more concrete document, so these two documents, 'Religious Freedom' and 'Nostra ætate', joined to 'Gaudium et spes' are an important trilogy, but whose importance only appeared in the following decades, and we are still working on it. [And Pope Ratzinger concludes with the false restoration]: There was the Council of the Fathers, the true one, and the Council of the media, of the journalists [progressive]... The true Council had difficulties in materializing... But the real strength of the Council was there and it is being realized progressively and ever more... it is also the true reform and the true renewal of the Church."

### Important comments after he became pope emeritus

On February 28, 2013, he became pope emeritus and some conservatives then presented themselves as the new "false restorers": Cardinal Brandmüller, Card. Burke, Card. Müller, Card. Sarah... The new false restorers reproduce themselves, they present themselves as conservatives on certain points to make Vatican II more easily accepted by traditionalists, this is the school of Benedict XVI.

*   **Card. Walter Brandmüller, a "conservative", affirms that Vatican II is infallible, O.R. 15.02.2013:**
    > "It is an inescapable truth of faith that the magisterial statements of an ecumenical council are the infallible expression of the revealed divine truth... We cannot admit an error on the part of a general council... So an interpretation of the Council that allows for the recognition of the organic development of the 'depositum fidei' must also be possible. [sic] ... For Vatican II too, it is the post-conciliar magisterium that authentically and coherently interprets the conciliar texts with the entire tradition of the faith..."

*   **Card. Walter Brandmüller says that in "Lumen gentium" the Council of Trent "is present" O.R. 02.12.2013:**
    > "The constitution 'Lumen gentium', which expounds the teaching on the Church, refers for a good 16 times [uselessly] to the doctrinal documents of the Council of Trent; so it is still present in the doctrine and in the life of the Church 150 years later."
    *[This is false, for example they accepted the Protestant doctrine on Justification, on 31.10.1999, condemned by 33 excommunications of the Council of Trent, and prepared by Ratzinger for 20 years.]*

*   **The false restoration in explicit form: one must criticize the progressives but save Vatican II:**
    > **Cardinal Walter Kasper: "Maritain, Henri de Lubac. Unlike Lefebvre, they did not criticize the Council itself, but they criticized its reception." They say that Vatican II is ambiguous, not false, in fact if they had to explain themselves, it is because the texts were not clear but they do not say that they were false, for example the text on religious freedom]**

*   **This text by Cardinal Walter Kasper is an important text and is published while Benedict XVI was already pope emeritus.**
    > **O.R. 12.04.2013:** "The conciliar texts contain an enormous potential for conflict; they open the door to a selective reception in one direction or another... One can distinguish three phases of reception... the first enthusiastic phase... the reaction was not long in coming. It came not only from Archbishop Lefebvre and the Society of St. Pius X that he founded, but also from theologians who during the Council were in the progressive ranks (Maritain, Henri de Lubac). Unlike Lefebvre, they did not criticize the Council itself, but they criticized its reception... Paul VI spoke of 'Smoke of Satan' entering through some cracks into the temple of God [Attention! Read carefully what will follow, because the false restoration is officially declared there, Ratzinger's fundamental thesis in his 'The Ratzinger Report']. At the extraordinary Episcopal Synod of 1985, twenty years after the end of the Council, the third phase of reception began [the false restoration]... (The synod) spoke of ambivalent situations in which, in addition to the negative aspects, there were also good fruits: the liturgical renewal... the ecumenical rapprochements; the openings to the modern world... And finally, every particular statement must be interpreted within the framework of the hierarchy of truths... Pope Benedict XVI in his speech to the Curia... on December 22, 2005 opposed two hermeneutics: that of discontinuity and rupture, which he rejected, and that of reform and renewal. The pope... did not oppose, as many affirm, the hermeneutic of discontinuity to the hermeneutic of continuity. The pope spoke of a hermeneutic of reform and renewal in the continuity of the Church... Already in 1963 Joseph Ratzinger had drawn attention to the fact that unity in the Petrine ministry must not necessarily be understood as an administrative unity, but it leaves space for a multiplicity of administrative, disciplinary and liturgical forms. [They repeat the doctrine of their master Ratzinger: 'The new people of God', Part II, ch.IV: 'The unitary ecclesiastical law, the unitary liturgy, the unitary assignment of episcopal sees by the Roman central authority, these are things that do not necessarily flow from the primacy as such'] John Paul II... invited to meditate on new forms of exercise of the primacy. Benedict XVI took up this phrase at least twice."

*   **Lucetta Scaraffia confirms, for those who still have not understood, that Ratzinger is an "misunderstood innovator". O.R. 13.02.2013:**
    > "He who has not understood the innovative scope of the figure of Josef Ratzinger and his pontificate, who has continued to see him, to interpret his words and his actions as proof of conservatism and refusal of novelty, has been strongly denied by his sudden and unforeseen resignation, an absolute novelty... His pontificate, in fact, has been characterized above all by a great and profound intellectual work [She confirms that Ratzinger made the doctrinal Revolution published in his 'Opera omnia']... The priority of his pontificate was to begin a process of evangelization [doctrinal] and purification [doctrinal] of the Church... He has not ceased to denounce, in his speeches to the Curia, the poisonous effects of internal struggles." [Card. Bertone spoke of a "nest of vipers"... it is the new pentecost].

*   **Lucetta Scaraffia, explains clearly and keeps us informed about Benedict XVI's methods of false restoration. She affirms that Ratzinger was a conservative as a cardinal, and subversive as a pope:**
    > **Lucetta Scaraffia O.R. 03.03.2013:** "The end of a pontificate constitutes a key moment in the history of the Church... to take stock of the situation... The pontificate of Joseph Ratzinger has been revolutionary... but his particular way of being revolutionary has contributed above all to overcoming the scheme by which, since the 18th century, the internal life of the Church was read historically, and therefore opposed conservatives and reformers. In fact, if a pope implements such revolutionary processes, while as a cardinal he wanted to identify himself, as the most authorized representative, with the conservative wing, everything takes on another dimension. One then understands that the reforms [the subversion] are not only those taken into account by the so-called progressives, but can be varied and much more incisive. It is a change in the way of interpreting the action of the Church, [and they tell you!] which every commentator and historian will have to take into account in the future." [That is to say that in the future it will be the "conservatives" who will make Vatican II accepted, as we will see with the next "conservative" pope after Pope Francis.]

    > **[The Left, in a Catholic-communist magazine in Rome with mocking lucidity, justifies the fact that Ratzinger must present himself as a conservative to get the changes in the Church passed. "Adista" 30.04.2005: "If the Church needs changes, Ratzinger could have said... (at the Conclave) it is good that I lead them myself: it will be easier to make them accepted."]**

    > **[Even the Marxists have understood that certain reforms (revolutions) would be better done by Benedict XVI, and have we understood it? It is the same method that is used in politics when it is the leaders of the 'right' who propose subversive laws: it is more effective because their political base remains paralyzed and reacts less than if they were made by the left.]**

*   **Lucetta Scaraffia confirms that it was Benedict XVI who sowed Francis O.R. 12.12.2013:**
    > "From Benedict to Francis, the quiet Revolution... was a quiet revolution... Benedict... the work of purification [doctrinal] of the faith... Francis will draw the practical consequences with an easier and more immediate language, dense with concrete examples [If you have not understood, they tell you themselves in the Osservatore Romano: Benedict, more doctrinal, sowed and Francis, more theatrical, makes it grow!] the popes continue the revolution of Ratzinger. [Thank you for officially explaining it because there are traditionalists who have not yet understood.]"

    > **[The same Catholic-communist Roman magazine, lets us know to what point of apostasy have succumbed the unfortunate ones who have abandoned the position of Mgr Lefebvre to submit to Vatican II. "Adista", 04.03.2002: "Licinio Rangel, [Brazilian, consecrated bishop in place of Mgr de Castro Mayer by the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X] made a profession of faith, he pronounced the oath of fidelity to the Pope declaring to accept all the teachings of Vatican II...... Father Cottier... Campos... Little by little it will be necessary to foresee new steps: for example that they also participate in celebrations in the reformed rite. But we must not be in a hurry."]**

### On the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council

**Outside the Second Vatican Council, no salvation**

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI "The binding nature of the Second Vatican Council". O.R. 08.07.2007:**
    > "It is feared first of all that the Authority [sic] of the Second Vatican Council is being undermined and that one of its essential decisions – the liturgical reform – is being called into question. This fear is unfounded... The last edition of the Missale Romanum... of 1962... may, on the contrary, be used as an extraordinary form of the liturgical celebration. It is not appropriate to speak of these two editions of the Roman Missal as if they were 'two rites'. It is rather a dual use of the one and same rite ['same'?]. We all know that, in the movement led by Archbishop Mgr Lefebvre, fidelity to the old Missal has become its external symbol; but the reasons for this rift have deeper roots [We agree with Benedict XVI that it is not about the issue of the Mass, which can be granted with an 'indult']. Many people who clearly accepted the binding nature of the Second Vatican Council [Benedict XVI tells us that it is no longer a pastoral council] and who were faithful to the Pope and the Bishops, also wished to rediscover the form of the Holy Liturgy to which they were attached [for archaeologism]... The Pope thus wanted to help especially the Society of Saint Pius X to find full unity with the successor of Peter... It is a matter of achieving an internal reconciliation within the Church."

*   **Card. Ratzinger in Chile, he reaffirms the intention to remain firm and hard in the liberal Revolution of the Church:**
    > "It is necessary to defend the Second Vatican Council against Mgr Lefebvre, as a duty that obliges vis-à-vis the Church and as a permanent necessity." (Speech of Cardinal Ratzinger to the bishops of Chile, "Concilium", 1988).

*   **2011 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. Fernando Ocáriz, Vicar General of Opus Dei, O.R. 02.12.2011:** "The pastoral aim of the Council does not mean that it is not doctrinal... 'provided with the authority of Christ' (Lumen gentium, no. 25)... At the Second Vatican Council, there were various novelties of a doctrinal nature on the sacramental character of the episcopate, episcopal collegiality, religious freedom, etc... The texts of the Second Vatican Council and the previous magisterial documents mutually clarify each other. [This is not true because they are opposite to each other] The Second Vatican Council must not only be interpreted in the light of previous magisterial documents, but some of the latter are also better understood in the light of Vatican II... [this is, for the moment, the maximum of modernism, interpreting the traditional Magisterium in the light of liberal religious freedom] These are novelties... but which on the doctrinal level do not contradict the previous magisterial documents [Yes, they do 'contradict' it]... serene and joyful adherence to the Magisterium, authentic interpreter of the doctrine and of the faith."

### For the 50th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council

*   **2012 Pope Benedict XVI in Frascati, O.R. 16.07.2012:**
    > "Fifty years after the opening of the Second Vatican Council. The documents of the Council contain an enormous richness for the formation of the new Christian generations and for the formation of our conscience."

*   **2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Cardinal Tauran, O.R. 12.12.2012:** "General de Gaulle... confided to him that, in his opinion, the council was the most important event of the 20th century, not only for the Church but for the world... [the devil recognizes his own]. ... for the first time... The conferences of Father Congar, Father Chenu... the difference between what was taught at the Gregorian and the ideas that were germinating in the conciliar hall... for the first time the Magisterium recognized that holiness could also be found in other religions... To modify the liturgy means to modify the idea we have of God, of the priest and of the Church [we are painfully in agreement, we hope that the faithful will understand the explicit subversion]... The third theme... with Vatican II and the affirmation of collegiality, the institution of the Synod of bishops and the creation of Episcopal Conferences, ... 'Lumen gentium' begins by defining the Church as a sacrament, 'that is, the sign and instrument of its intimate union with God and the unity of the whole human race'... all this is the fruit of Vatican II... In fifty years we have passed from the regime of Christendom to a Church of communion... in order to establish universal fraternity... The council made the Church pass from exclusion to inclusion." [One is amazed to see with what clarity the men of Vatican II openly declare that this is the Revolution in the Church and affirm that we have passed from Catholic fraternity to Masonic fraternity. It is truly the 'hermeneutic of rupture'].

### *The master of Vatican II, the 'Opera Omnia'

**Here is why we study Benedict XVI and his work through the Osservatore Romano**

*   **Card. Bertone O.R. 28.08.2009:** "The thought of Benedict XVI... from the texts published in the Osservatore Romano... it would not be difficult to reconstruct his project for the Church and society."
*   **Mgr. G.L. Müller, O.R. 11.12.2013:** "Benedict XVI exposes... his fundamental Christological perspective presented systematically in his book 'Introduction to Christianity' (1968)."
*   **Card. Gerhard Müller, O.R 19.04.2015:** "In the long years of his academic activity as a professor of fundamental and dogmatic theology, Ratzinger elaborated an autonomous theological work, which places him in the line of the greatest theologians of the 20th and 21st centuries. For more than fifty years, his name has been synonymous with a complete original project of systematic theology."

**Ratzinger with his "Opera omnia" created the "complete doctrinal project" of the new church and the new conciliar religion, and this is what is currently studied in seminaries. Ratzinger with his "Opera omnia" laid the doctrinal foundations of the conciliar religion.**

**Pope Ratzinger has these ideas published in his "Opera omnia" by having it declared that: O.R. 23.10.2008 "Each volume individually is expressly authorized by the Holy Father."**

**The Vatican intensely promotes Ratzinger's "Opera Omnia" through numerous articles and full pages in the Osservatore Romano.**

*   **2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. G.L. Müller, Interview, O.R. 26.07.2012:** "Benedict XVI entrusted you with the publication of his 'Opera Omnia'. 'As a young student I read the book 'Introduction to Christianity' published in 1968, and we practically absorbed it like sponges... 'What do you think of the Lefebvrists?' ... The Second Vatican Council affirmed wonderful things.'"

    > **Card. Bagnasco, president of the CEI, O.R. 09.12.2010:** "The 'Opera Omnia', intended to collect in an organic and systematic way his theological reflection."

    > **Osservatore Romano, 16.09.2009:** "Presents the second volume of 'Gesammelte Schriften' (Opera omnia) by Ratzinger."

    > **Osservatore Romano, 28.10.2010:** "'Invitation to read' the Opera Omnia of Joseph Ratzinger."

    > **L'Osservatore Romano: O.R. 28.06.2010:** "Opera Omnia... the IVth volume opens with 'Introduction to Christianity'" [this book is a cesspool of heresies].

    > **Osservatore Romano, 03.12.2012:** "Card. Varella, presents the 'Obras Completas de Josef Ratzinger'... The complete works of Josef Ratzinger will be published in Spanish in seventeen volumes. The BAC plans to publish three volumes per year... The person responsible for the publication is Mgr. G.L. Müller."

    > **Mgr. Gerhard Ludwig Müller, O.R. 15.03.2012:** "The Opera Omnia of Ratzinger... It is Eucharistic ecclesiology... The Pope: 'there is not a doctrine of the eucharist and a doctrine of the Church, but they are the same thing [they are not the same thing]... The Lord communicates himself to men, enters into communion with them and thus puts them in communion with each other.'" [This is Ratzinger's theory according to which he who possesses a valid eucharist, for example the Orthodox, belongs to the Body of Christ. It is therefore not the Roman Magisterium that founds the unity of the Church].

***

## Revolution of the Papacy

### In general

*Pope Benedict XVI was elected on April 19, 2005 and suppressed the tiara and modified the modalities of the election of the pope.*

*It is Ratzinger who theorizes the change of the papacy carried out by Pope Francis with the 147-page document "The Bishop of Rome" of 13.06.2024. You will find a complete summary on our website.*

*Ratzinger says in "The New People of God" (Part II, Chapter 4.3): "The question of the interpretation of Vatican I... Creates a 'third position' that does not allow for making the episcopate a mere instrument of the papacy."*

*   **1969 Card. Ratzinger, "The new people of God", 1969, Part II, ch. IV, the essential is to understand that Ratzinger also teaches a new conception of the universal Church (we will address this theme in chap. IV):**
    > "The Patriarchates owe their origin to a non-Roman privilege... What I wanted to highlight above all is that Rome, on this level, has no right over the other Patriarchates... has no mandate of central administration [Card. Ratzinger cites Anselm of Havelberg; he finds him 'grandiose'] However now the Roman Church..., separated from us... erecting itself into a monarchy... The Church of Rome has always assumed in the West... a rank which conferred on it a position very much beyond what was signified by the Petrine primacy... The attachment of the whole West to the liturgy of the city of Rome... Thus the plural of *ecclesiae* disappears more and more... the city of Rome incorporates the whole Latin *orbis*... The whole West... loses more and more the ancient structure of unity in plurality... The most obvious example of this process is the transformation of the conception of the patriarchate... The cardinalate is an institution of the city of Rome... The patriarchate is an institution at the level of the universal church... The cardinalate now presents itself more and more as a charge at the level of the universal Church. [Card. Ratzinger manifests where, for him, the main error is, and thus shows where one of his main heresies is]: Precisely because the Universal Church is identified with the Church of the City of Rome, from the 13th century the cardinal becomes superior to the patriarch... In the unity of the one *Ecclesia* there must be room for the plural of *ecclesiae*: only the faith is indivisible... Everything else can be different [sic]. The image of state centralism... does not derive simply from the function of Peter... The unitary ecclesiastical law, the unitary liturgy, the unitary assignment of episcopal sees by the Roman central authority, these are things that do not necessarily flow from the primacy as such... ...to create new patriarchates without considering them incorporated into the Latin [Roman] church. Therefore to accept unity with the pope would no longer mean to attach oneself to a unitary administration. The unity with Rome, in the structure and in the concrete actualization of the life of the communities, could be as 'impalpable' as in the ancient church." [Card. Ratzinger has succeeded in 'volatilizing' the papacy]

*   **Card. Ratzinger, "The new people of God", (Part III, chap. 2):**
    > "It is possible and even necessary to make a critique of certain papal declarations... Where the unanimity of the universal Church does not exist... a binding decision is not possible... One can therefore perceive as a deviation... the Christian reaction... in the Syllabus of Pius IX and in the pontificate of Pius X."

*   **1985 Card. Ratzinger, The Principles of Catholic Theology, Paris, Téqui, 1985, p. 222):**
    > "Rome must not demand from the East, concerning the doctrine of the primacy, more than what was formulated and lived during the first millennium."

*   **1990 Card. Ratzinger, delegitimizing the Popes of before O.R. 27.06.1990:**
    > "The Document (Instructio)... affirms, perhaps for the first time with such clarity, that there are decisions which may not be the last word on the matter as such... it is... also an expression of pastoral prudence, a kind of provisional disposition... they may need further rectifications... one can think of the declarations of the Popes... on religious freedom... of the anti-modernist decisions... of the decisions of the Biblical Commission."

*   **1996 Card. Ratzinger Speech at the Symposium on "The Primacy of the Successor of Peter" O.R. 02.12.1996:**
    > "Meanwhile the Holy Father, promulgating the encyclical *Ut unum sint* (May 1995), affirmed... 'Listening to the request made to me to find a form of exercise of the Primacy which, while in no way renouncing the essential of its mission, can open up to a new situation' (95).... Also emphasizing the theological dimension of Tradition, to determine what was considered *depositum fidei* during the first millennium on the Primacy of the successor of Peter, and how the conviction of faith on this subject has progressed up to the definition of Vatican I and the teaching of Vatican II... taking into account the principle, also mentioned in the letter of the CDF (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) *Communionis notio*, to the bishops of the Catholic Church, on certain aspects of the Church considered as communion, that it is necessary to distinguish in the ministry of Peter the substance of divine institution, from the concrete forms or expressions of its exercise carried out over the past two millennia" (cf no. 17)... the increase in knowledge of historical data (and exegetical with reference to the Bible), leads to a deepened theological vision of the Roman Primacy and of the ecclesiological function. This will help to always better distinguish what is necessary, and which cannot be renounced, from what is accidental and not essential to the truth of faith." [We recommend reading the entire text]

*   **1998 Card. Ratzinger, O.R. 31.10.1998:**
    > "The Primacy... cannot be conceived as a monarchy of a political nature. Avoid relapses... of Gallicanism and Ultramontanism."

*   **2000 Card. Ratzinger, O.R. 04.03.2000:**
    > "The ministry of the successor of Peter is a particular case of the episcopal ministry... the distinction between the nature of the Petrine ministry and the possible modalities of its exercise... the immutable nature of the Primacy of the Successor of Peter has been expressed historically by modalities of exercise adequate to the circumstances of a pilgrim Church in a changing world. [Ratzinger continues to historicize historical reality to justify that it is then possible to change it]... It is however fundamental and necessary to affirm that the distinction between the nature of the Petrine ministry and the possible modalities of its exercise must be made *in Ecclesia*, that is to say under the assistance of the Holy Spirit [Sic, it must be the Pope who changes the papacy. And Pope Francis, a disciple of Ratzinger, wrote the document 'The Bishop of Rome' on 13.06.2024, where he overturns the papacy.]"

*   **Archbishop Cosmo Francesco Ruppi, O.R., 28.09.2000:**
    > "Paul VI... already in April 1967 recognized that the Primacy is 'the greatest obstacle on the path of ecumenism.'"

*   **2003 Card. Ratzinger O.R. 10.05.2003:**
    > "It is no longer the Magisterium that imposes norms on exegetes... It is the opening of Vatican II... However, let us not condemn the past lightly."

*   **2006 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. Angelo Amato, O.R. 26.5.2006:** "One can then affirm that the ministry of the Holy Father will be under the sign of charity inside and outside the Catholic Church."

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 15.03.2007:**
    > "The council of Nicaea speaks of three 'primacies': that of Rome, but Alexandria and Antioch also participate in a certain sense in a 'primacy'."

*   **With the theory of "the same structure of the Church of the origins" and of the "protos", it is taught that the Pope is the "first": "protos" among the Catholic and Orthodox leaders.**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI, 26.09.2011:** "Orthodoxy is theologically the closest to us Catholics and the Orthodox have preserved the same structure of the Church of the origins."
    *[Benedict XVI means that the 'Church of the origins' did not have papal primacy. On the contrary, it was there from the beginning, Peter was recognized as head but the definition made by Vatican I was not yet there, the same goes for other dogmas, there was the thing but not the definition, that is, the truth was lived but not yet defined.]*

*   **2007 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Kasper O.R. 05.12.2007:** "The Chair of Peter... has become an ecumenical center." [Our Lady of La Salette had already predicted it: "Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the Antichrist." Later, Leo XIII also denounced it following the miraculous vision he had about the future of the Church, original text of the exorcism of Leo XIII. "Where the See of the blessed Peter has been established... there they have placed the abominable throne of their impiety."]

    > **Mgr. Fortino, in the assessment of relations with the Orthodox, O.R. 18.1.2008:** "In the three levels, the presence of a *protos*, a *primus*, who exercises a particular role in the field of communion is highlighted... The two parties agree that Rome... occupied the first place in the *taxis*, and that the bishop of Rome is therefore the *protos* among the patriarchs."

    > **Mgr. Fortino O.R. 17.11.2007:** "The role of the bishop of Rome... the ecclesiological consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church [He means by this that the Church must unite all men. Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 30.06.2007: 'The Church manifests itself as a "sacrament", that is, "sign and instrument of the intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human race."']... mode of exercising communion... The bishop of Rome is the 'protos' among the patriarchs."

    > **Mgr. Fortino, O.R. 07.11.2007:** "The theme that was treated in Ravenna also has a more recent and more complex history. A project had been prepared in Moscow in 1990."
    *[How many people know that in Moscow is the University of the Revolution created by the Soviets? And the university of the Counter-Revolution where there would be faculties to methodically study the history, doctrines, metamorphoses of the Revolution, the books, the analyses, etc. of the revolutionaries, where is it? Pope Pius XI in "Quas primas" warns us against the negligence of the so-called "good": "In fact, the empire of Christ over all men began to be denied... the Christian religion was assimilated to other false religions... ...This state of affairs must perhaps be attributed to the apathy or timidity of the good, who abstain from fighting or resist weakly; from this the enemies of the Church draw more temerity and audacity. But when all the faithful understand that they must fight, with courage and without respite, under the banner of Christ the King...]*

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 06.03.2008:**
    > "This responsibility the Pontiff knew how to exercise in the West and in the East, He demonstrated in this way how the exercise of the Roman primacy was necessary at the time, as it still is today, to effectively achieve communion, a characteristic of the one Church of Christ."

*   **Collegiality in the new Code of Canon Law, O.R. 12.01.2008:**

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 08.07.2010:**
    > "The People of God is 'the preceding magisterium' which must then be deepened and intellectually welcomed by theology."

*   **2010 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **L'Osservatore Romano, in its Editorial of 22.09.2010:** "Between Catholics and Orthodox... 'on three levels: local, regional and universal, and it affirms that on each of these levels, there is a *pròtos*, a *primus* (bishop, metropolitan-patriarch, bishop of Rome). So, entering more directly into the problematic of the *pròtos* on the universal level, it is said that 'the two parties (Catholics and Orthodox) agree on the fact that Rome, as the Church that presides in charity, [only in charity and not in doctrine?] occupied the first place in the *taxis* and that the bishop of Rome was the *pròtos* among the Patriarchs... What is the specific function of the bishop of the 'first see' in an ecclesiology of 'koinonia'? To achieve a desirable and possible shared interpretation.'"
    *[Pope Francis, we repeat, had the document 'The Bishop of Rome' of 147 pages published on June 13, 2024. It is under the pontificate of Benedict XVI that one begins to speak of the pope as 'The Bishop of Rome'. In this document, still in the school of Benedict XVI and his theologians, it is taught that the time has come to also change the papacy. This is the first methodical plan-program to modify the Primacy of the pope in the years to come. Find one of our first studies on our website.]*
    *Pope Francis reintroduced the title of "Patriarch of Rome" in the 2024 Pontifical Yearbook. "Pontifical Yearbook 2024, Pope Francis becomes Patriarch of the West again", is the article by Andrea Gagliarducci, Vatican City, April 10, 2024 (ACI Stampa).*

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 26.09.2011:**
    > "We know that it is especially on the question of the primacy that we must continue, with patience and humility, the efforts for its just understanding. I think that the reflections concerning the discernment between the nature and the form of the exercise of the primacy, as John Paul II made them in the encyclical 'Ut unum sint' (1995), can still give fruitful impulses." [Let's get ready]

*On the general theme of the papacy, review the important speech reported above by Pope Benedict XVI to the clergy of Rome (O.R. 16.02.2013) which is a summary of Vatican II and his pontificate.*

*The purpose of the new doctrine of Ratzinger-Benedict XVI on the primacy of the pope is to delegitimize the infallible and irreformable magisterium of the popes before Vatican II.*

### The theory of the "protos"

"Protos", that is, the pope becomes the first among the patriarchs, even among schismatic Orthodox.

*   **2007 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. Eleuterio Fortino, editorial of L'O.R. 17.11.2007:** "The role of the bishop of Rome... the ecclesiological consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church... mode of exercising communion... At this level the *Protoi* must recognize who is the first among them. The novelty of the document is what is affirmed at this third level, ...'the two sides (Catholics and Orthodox), agree on the fact that Rome, as the Church that presides in charity [and not in faith], occupied the first place in the *taxis* and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the *pròtos* among the patriarchs.'"

    > **Mgr. Fortino O.R. of 30.11.2007:** "There is a first, a *pròtos*, who has a particular function, respectively the bishop in the diocese, the patriarch in the patriarchate and the Bishop of Rome as *pròtos* on the universal level... the study is not finished."

*   **2009 Card. Kasper, O.R. 3.7.2009:**
    > "The pontificate of Benedict XVI, welcomed with enthusiasm by the Orthodox Churches... The Orthodox side recognizes that 'The Church is effective at the local, regional and universal level, and that one of these levels, the universal, needs a primacy, that is, a *pròtos*. And the *Pròtos* at the universal level is naturally the Bishop of Rome. Benedict XVI, moreover, has recalled this proposal.'"

*   **2012 Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 18.01.2012:**
    > "In the magisterium of Benedict XVI it is the Christological foundation... The cause of ecumenism is the guiding thread of his pontificate. He refers to the 'purification of memory' and foresees in the 'interior conversion'... but he already exercises now... an ecumenical primacy. ... I will therefore concentrate on the essential point of his ecumenical action... On this essential support of the Christological faith lies the ecumenical vision of Pope Benedict XVI [Christ yes, the Church no, this is the Protestant thesis] ...One could draw the erroneous conclusion that the unity of the Church in the final analysis is only an internal reality. On the contrary, Pope Benedict XVI emphasizes that... it must be visible in this world [a single world church, external, visible, formal]... According to the Pope's interpretation, he has absolutely no intention of referring the unity of Christ's disciples to the end of time or of referring it to eschatology... the visible ecumenical unity of the Church, that is to say in the sense of the unity of Churches that remain Churches and at the same time become a single Church... not as a philanthropy, but as Christ logically founded. [This is always the thesis of Benedict XVI: doctrinal union, otherwise it would only be a form of unstable 'social contract' (O.R.28.01.2012) and this could not last in time] ... Pope Benedict XVI reveals himself to be the greatest ecumenist of our time [Thank you for confirming this truth with authority, so he is 'the greatest' subversive and not a 'restorer' of the Catholic faith]."
    *[Citation from a Catholic-communist magazine in Rome, Adista 29.01.2005: "To this context, the words of Ratzinger on a world-sized Church 'which cannot be governed in a monarchical way: with time, a way will be found to create a profound collaboration between the bishops and the Pope' still apply."]*

## Change of ecclesiology

### In general

*   **2000 Card. Ratzinger openly teaches in "Dominus Iesus" the error that there is a church greater and higher than the Roman Catholic Church, he teaches that there is a new universal Church, O.R. 08.10.2000:**
    > "Therefore the council fathers meant that the being of the Church, as such, is an entity greater than the Roman Catholic Church."

*   **Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the presentation of *Dominus Iesus* declares it obligatory. O.R. 06.09.2000:**
    > "The teachings of the truths of faith and of Catholic doctrine that it contains (*Dominus Iesus*), require from all the faithful a definitive and irrevocable consent... The Declaration presents itself... in fidelity and continuity [sic] with the ecclesial Tradition."

*   **2001 Card. Ratzinger at the Congress of Aversa, important text: O.R. 17.09.2001:**
    > "The Church was finally recognized and experienced as something internal... not as an institution... What constitutes the Church are prayer and communion in the sacraments... In this theme is finally contained the idea of development, and therefore of the historical dynamic of the Church... For Newman, the idea of development was the true bridge that led him to convert to Catholicism... a new awareness. Above all... Henri de Lubac... highlighted that the term 'Corpus Mysticum', originally characterizes the holy Eucharist... What is meant by 'Eucharistic ecclesiology?'... The first point is that the last supper of Jesus becomes the true founding act of the Church... indeed the Eucharist binds men to each other... and with Christ, and thus it makes them Church [Orthodox, etc.]. With this the fundamental constitution of the Church is given... The Church lives in Eucharistic community. Christ is everywhere whole... in union with the Orthodox brothers... The first correction [the Magisterium is corrected]... is found in Henri de Lubac who concretizes the idea of 'Body of Christ' in the sense of Eucharistic ecclesiology... The other... in Germany... They proposed the concept of 'People of God'... the Church has not yet reached its goal... to express the historicity of the Church... The internal unity of the people of God, beyond the sacramental borders... the different ways in which attachment and orientation to the Church are possible and real, even beyond the confines of the Catholic Church... They are possible only if one does not want or no longer manages to see the great Church conceived by God." ["The great Church"... invented by Card. Ratzinger].

*   **Benedict XVI wants doctrinal union, practical union: the "social contract" is not enough for him, he knows that the Revolution in the Church requires the change of doctrine.**
    > **2012 Pope Benedict XVI to the plenary assembly of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, O.R. 28.01.2012:** "Today we can see a number of good fruits produced by the ecumenical dialogues.... The center of the true ecumenical problem on the other hand is faith, in which man encounters the truth that is revealed in the Word of God. Without faith the ecumenical movement would be reduced to a form of 'social contract' to which one adheres out of common interest, a logic of praxis to create a better world. The logic of the Second Vatican Council is totally different: the sincere search for the unity of all Christians. Fundamentally, among other things, one must discern between Tradition and traditions. ... An important step for such a discernment was made in the preparation and application of the dispositions for groups of faithful who come from Anglicanism and who wish to enter into full communion in the Church, in the unity of the common and essential divine Tradition, while conserving their own spiritual, liturgical and pastoral traditions, which are in conformity with the Catholic Church. [The 'Catholic' Church of Vatican II can accept Protestants as they are because it has accepted their doctrines, for example the 1999 Protestant Justification Agreement, the religious freedom of Vatican II... etc.] In fact, in the different Christian Confessions there exists a spiritual richness, an expression of the one faith, a gift to be shared and to be found together in the Tradition of the Church... It is important, moreover, to provide a correct interpretation of this 'order' or 'hierarchy' in the truths of Catholic doctrine, highlighted in the Decree *Unitatis redintegratio* (no. II). It is important to speak with one voice on these themes, [that is to say with a single doctrine]."

*   **2005 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI, a few days after his election, makes it known through Mgr. Bruno Forte, on two large pages of the Osservatore Romano, that his ideas as a theologian, bishop and Prefect of the Congregation for the Faith, are the reference point of his pontificate. Especially those contained in his (subversive) book "The New People of God".**

    > **Archbishop Bruno Forte, O.R. 24.4.2005 "'The ecclesial theology of Josef Ratzinger'. The theological production of J. Ratzinger... The work of the future Benedict XVI... influenced the conscience of the Church of Vatican II and of the post-Council until our days... Ratzinger does so by examining another axiom 'extra Ecclesiam nulla salus' (J. Ratzinger, '"No salvation outside the Church?", The new people of God', part IV, chap. 2). The Church... can never presume to be an absolute... This Catholic unity is expressed historically in the variety of its concretizations [sic]... the universal Church manifests itself as a communion of Churches ('The new people of God' Part II, chap. 7). ... The ecclesiology prior to Vatican II... The Council goes beyond this bipolar scheme... The formula *subsistit* of *Lumen gentium* 8, is the proof. The Council, observes Ratzinger: 'renounced the east of an absolute identification (Corpus Christi est Ecclesia Romana Catholica)... in this light Ratzinger has no difficulty in affirming that: 'Rome must not demand from the East, concerning the doctrine on the primacy, more than what was formulated and also lived during the first millennium. ...On the one hand the East... accepts the Catholic Church as legitimate... on the other hand the West recognizes as orthodox and legitimate the Church of the East in the form it has preserved' (J. Ratzinger, 'The principles of Catholic theology', Paris, Téqui, 1982)."**

    > **L'Osservatore Romano, 13.12.2010:** "Episcopal collegiality. ... One must not however conclude that the Episcopal College has no authority of its own in the Council, as if the authority were entirely transmitted to it by the Roman Pontiff."

*   **2011 Inos Biffi changes the meaning of the dogma "outside the Church no salvation", 12.06.2011:**
    > "Is the affirmation that 'outside the Church there is no salvation' still valid?... The characteristic of the Church of being People of God... has seduced the post-conciliar ecclesiologists... Where his Body is, there is the Church."
    *[This is Ratzinger's thesis according to which he who has the Eucharist belongs to the Body of Christ, therefore to the Church. We repeat that it was Ratzinger-Benedict XVI who was the first to question with authority this dogma, as stated by Mgr Bruno Forte, O.R. 24/04/2005 (see previous article). See also Card. Cantalamessa, sermon in the presence of Pope Francis, O.R. 02.12.2022: "The traditional axiom: 'Outside the Church there is no salvation'... is no longer the case... would it not end... with the axiom 'outside the faith there is no salvation?'" While the Magisterium has taught this dogma for centuries, from Boniface VIII to Pope Pius IX who on 10.08.1863 declares: "The Catholic dogma is also well known, that is, that no one can be saved outside the Catholic Church" (Denz. 1677), Benedict XVI teaches the contrary O.R. 19.05.2008: "Here finally is the great synthesis of the Second Vatican Council: the Church, mystery of communion... of the whole human race". So "Outside the Church, there is no one left", all humanity has become "Church".]*

*   **Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 27.01.2012:**
    > "An era in the history of the Church is ending without new horizons being already visible... this will only be possible through a new pentecost... The Church of the future."

*   **Card. Marc Ouellet demonstrates that the theses of Benedict XVI have been well assimilated, the change of doctrine is effective. O.R. 10.06.2012:**
    > "Pope Benedict XVI has made a great contribution to this reflection... Speech to the Roman Curia of December 22, 2005. It is enough to recall the liturgical reform, episcopal collegiality, synodality, ecumenism, to touch on the well-known nerve points of the ecclesiology of communion and its interpretation... The relationship between the universal Church... and the particular Churches presuppose a Eucharistic ecclesiology, preceded by a baptismal ecclesiology... The Second Vatican Council was certainly a wind of pentecost that freed the Church from its isolation from the modern world and from its ecclesiological limits [sic]."

### "The Church is founded on the Eucharist and not on the Faith taught by the Roman Magisterium

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 09.05.2005:**
    > "Thanks to the Eucharist the Church is born anew each time! The Church is nothing other than this network – the Eucharistic community – in which each of us receives the same Lord, thus becoming a single body that embraces the whole world... And the Eucharist, as the present love of Jesus Christ, is the criterion of all doctrine."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 16.02.2013:**
    > "But it was only after the Council that an element was brought to light, which in the Council itself remained a little hidden, that is: the link between 'People of God' and 'Body of Christ'. It is truly communion with Christ in the Eucharistic union. Here we become the Body of Christ; that is to say that the relationship between People of God and Body of Christ creates a new reality: communion... communion as a central conception. [This is Ratzinger's theory that whoever has a valid Eucharist is part of the Church, for example the Orthodox]... But the real strength of the Council was there and it is being realized progressively and ever more... it is also the true reform and the true renewal of the Church."

*   **2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Mgr. Gerhard L. Müller, O.R. 15.03.2012:** "The Opera Omnia of Ratzinger... It is Eucharistic ecclesiology... The Pope: 'there is not a doctrine of the eucharist and a doctrine of the Church, but they are the same thing.'" ["the same thing"?]

    > **Card. Marc Ouellet demonstrates that the theses of Benedict XVI have been well assimilated: O.R. 10.06.2012:** "Pope Benedict XVI... The ecclesiology of communion and its interpretation... The relationship between the universal Church... and the particular Churches presuppose a Eucharistic ecclesiology."

    > **Osservatore Romano, 09.09.2011:** "The principle on which Orthodox ecclesiology is founded is therefore that of the 'Eucharistically and locally defined Church'." [This is the thesis of Benedict XVI O.R.09.05.2005: "The Church is nothing other than this network – the Eucharistic community".]

### What is the "Church as sacrament"?

*   **2001 Ratzinger in Aversa also explains what "Church as sacrament" means:**
    > **17.09.2001:** "The element of 'receiving' belongs essentially to the Church, just as faith is born of hearing and is not the product of its own decisions or reflections. Faith is indeed an encounter with what I can neither conceive nor produce by my own efforts, but which must come to meet me. This structure of reception, of encounter, we call 'Sacrament'." ["to receive" the ecumenical doctrines of Vatican II as the will of God?]

*   **SURGICAL OPERATION ON THE FAITH:**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 30.06.2005:** "The unity we seek is neither absorption nor fusion, but respect for the multiform fullness of the Church, which, in accordance with the will of its founder Jesus Christ..."

*   **2005 Pope Benedict XVI Catholic unity as a "symphony" of churches, O.R. 25.08.2005:**
    > "I hope that the dialogue... will contribute to increasing and maturing this ordered and harmonious 'symphony' which is Catholic unity... to give life to the other necessary transformations for the change of the world."

*   **Let us summarize Ratzinger's ideas on ecclesiology:**
    1.  The Universal Church is not identified with the Roman Church: Card. Ratzinger defends himself on 04.03.2000, from the suspicion of having identified the Universal Church with the Roman Church, in his Letter to the Bishops of 1995.
    > **Card. Ratzinger affirms that there is a Universal Church greater than the Catholic Church O.R. 04.03.2000:** "[that] The one universal Church [be] tacitly identified with the Roman Church, de facto, with the Pope and the Curia... In this text the identification of the universal Church with the Pope and the Curia is first presented as a hypothesis, as a danger, but then it seems in fact to be imputed to the Letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith... This ontological priority of the Universal Church, one Church, one body, one bride, over the empirical realizations... seems to me so obvious that it is difficult for me to understand the objections. They are possible only if one does not want or no longer manages to see the great Church conceived by God [For the Cardinal, the universal Church is not identified with the Roman Church but it is a "great Church conceived by God" which has not yet been realized, superior "to the empirical realizations"]... Jesus... at the last supper gave them a new unifying center, by which all who call themselves Christians... become one thing with him [Card. Ratzinger gives the Eucharist as the foundation of ecumenism: 'a new unifying center'... The Council distances itself... from Pius XII (*Mystici Corporis*) who had said: the Catholic Church is ('is') the one Mystical Body of Christ. In the difference between the 'subsistit' and the 'is' of Pius XII lies the whole ecumenical problem... [Conclusion: the Cardinal who always speaks of continuity, breaks with the previous Magisterium: it is the hermeneutic of rupture]:

*   **N. Friedmann, the modernists recognize Newman as a master of modernism O.R. 14.08.2004:**
    > "Newman... opened a new era... the profound discovery of the great Catholica... The Group of Dombes... to anchor itself to the Catholica... ... 'Ratzinger, a star that guides the ecumenical path'."

*   **Only the Left has understood Ratzinger's subversion, Adista, 10.12.2001:**
    > "All agree: the universal Church is not the Church of Rome. Ratzinger responds to Kasper."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 30.06.2005. [Here the Pope openly declares that for him, the Church, One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic is no longer the Roman Church, but "the multiform fullness of the Church"]:**
    > "The unity we seek is neither absorption nor fusion, but respect for the multiform fullness of the Church, which, in accordance with the will of its founder Jesus Christ, must always be One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic... He encouraged to consider the East and the West as tesserae that together compose the resplendent face of the Pantocrator, whose hand blesses the whole *Oikoumene*."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 30.06.2005:**
    > "This is the deepest meaning of catholicity, a catholicity... Catholicity means universality, multiplicity that becomes unity; unity that however remains multiplicity... We have already seen the capacity of peoples to surpass themselves and to look towards the one God who is part of this unity. In this perspective I greet cordially and with gratitude the delegation of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople... Unity that is already given to us to help the world to believe... The Church is not Holy by itself."

*   **2005 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Message of Pope Benedict XVI to Card. Kasper [The Pope suggests that we have, with the Orthodox, the same faith in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church] O.R. 05.09.2005:** "The dialogue... will bring out the common faith, with its theological and liturgical aspects, proper to the East and the West, which are complementary and dynamic for the edification of the People of God... To achieve the full communion of Christians must be the objective of all who profess faith in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church."

    > **Synod of Bishops "Instrumentum laboris" O.R. 08.07.2005:** "The Eastern Churches... No. 86. The Catholic Church recognizes the validity of the sacrament of the eucharist. Therefore, under certain conditions, the communion of Catholics in these aforementioned Churches is authorized, just as the members of these same Churches are received at the Altar of the Lord in the Catholic Church... In the light of this teaching one understands the affirmation that the Eucharist presupposes ecclesial communion."

    > **Message of the Synod of Bishops [Even the Synod defines the Roman Church as a "particular Church"], O.R.23.10.2005:** "The Holy Eucharist animates and transforms, both the life of our particular Churches of East and West, and the multiple human activities."

*   **2006 Pope Benedict XVI 0.R. 10.11.2006:**
    > "Given the difficulties that the Orthodox have with the autocephalous Churches, as well as the problems of our Protestant friends facing the disintegration of the regional Churches, we realize the great significance of universality, how important it is for the Church to open up to the totality, becoming in universality truly the one Church... We purify ourselves and help each other reciprocally."

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI repeats that the criterion of union in the Church is the Eucharist, O.R. 30.06.2007:**
    > "The bond of sacramental communion is the Eucharist... a great space in which it will be necessary to express... the universal Church and the particular Churches, [is] that of communion... the Church manifests itself as a 'sacrament', that is, 'sign and instrument of the intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human race.'"

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 11.10.2007:**
    > "The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church:... 'Ecclesiological and canonical consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church, ecclesial communion, conciliarity and authority'."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the Portuguese bishops, O.R. 11.11.2007:**
    > "It is necessary to change the style of organization of the Portuguese ecclesial community and the mentality of its members to have a Church in syntony with the Second Vatican Council."

*   **2007 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Osservatore Romano 30.06.2007:** "The universal Church and the particular Churches, [is] that of communion... the Church manifests itself as a 'sacrament', that is, 'sign and instrument of the intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human race.'" [The Osservatore Romano reiterates the doctrine of Benedict XVI, see above]

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 16.06.2008:**
    > "The Church has no confines... The religious confines are an invitation to evangelization in the perspective of 'communion' in diversity."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, O.R. 1.2.2008:**
    > "Reconcilable only in an eschatological perspective, could only generate a slowdown and in the final analysis the paralysis of ecumenism itself." [That is to say that the various Churches 'hidden in Jesus' must be reconciled before eschatology]. "The affirmation of the Second Vatican Council, that the true Church of Christ 'subsists in the Catholic Church' (*LG* no. 8), does not only concern the relationship with the Christian Churches and ecclesial communities, but it also includes the definition of the relationships with the religions and cultures of the world."

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI, 09.12.2011:**
    > "Assisi... a memorable event... ... God desires that we form a single family, in which we are all brothers and sisters."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 27.01.2011:**
    > "During the last decades, the ecumenical movement 'arisen under the impulse of the holy Spirit'.."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the Lutherans. O.R. 16.01.2011:**
    > "Because ecumenism is not our work, but the fruit of God's action."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 20.01.2011:**
    > "From these differences the Spirit creates a single and unique body."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 29.1.2011:**
    > "The sacramental nature of the Church." [The Church is not a sacrament]

### What he means by "People of God"

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI, All men are called to be part of the whole people of God. O.R. 16.10.2008:**
    > "This word 'Church' has a multidimensional meaning... Later, in the letter to the Ephesians, Paul will elaborate abundantly on the concept of the unity of the Church following the concept of the people of God... It opens to all peoples and unites them in a single people of God."

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, the "people of God" is the magisterium O.R. 08.07.2010:**
    > "The People of God is 'the preceding magisterium' which must then be deepened and intellectually welcomed by theology."

### "The Great Church" and the particular Churches

*   **1992 Card. Ratzinger, Document of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. O.R. 15.06.1992:**
    > "The concept of communion (koinonia) already highlighted in the texts of the Second Vatican Council is very appropriate... to offer a key to reading a renewed Catholic ecclesiology... one already finds in the apostolic era those which in themselves are 'Churches' since, while being particular, the universal Church is present in them, with all its essential elements... the Eastern Orthodox Churches... they therefore deserve the title of particular Churches."

*   **2006 Pope Benedict XVI, 23.02.2006:**
    > "For this the See of Rome... also received the charge entrusted by Christ to Peter, to be at the service of all the particular Churches, for the edification and unity of the whole people of God... The Chair of the Bishop of Rome represents, therefore, not only his service to the Roman community, but his mission of guide for the whole people of God."

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 30.06.2007:**
    > "A major area in which it will be necessary to express a decisive programmatic commitment, at the level of the universal Church and the particular Churches, is that of communion... It is in realizing this communion of love that the Church manifests itself as a 'sacrament', that is, 'sign and instrument of the intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human race.'"

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 13.03.2009:**
    > "But should not it, the great Church, also allow itself to be generous, conscious of its long breath?"

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 23.02.2009:**
    > "We read in the dogmatic Constitution on the Church that there are in the ecclesial communion legitimate particular Churches."

*   **2005-2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Message of the Synod of Bishops. Even the Synod defines the Roman Church as a "particular Church": O.R. 23.10.2005:** "The Holy Eucharist animates and transforms, both the life of our particular Churches of East and West, and the multiple human activities."

    > **Card. Levada, appointed prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 11.07.2007:** "The name of 'Church' to the separated Eastern Churches they deserve the title of 'particular or local Churches' (ibid.), and are called sister Churches of the particular Catholic Churches (ibid.)... even outside this visible subject, there exist true ecclesial realities... Moreover, the Declaration *Dominus Iesus* expressly calls them 'true particular Churches'... Catholic ecumenism may at first glance seem paradoxical."
    *[Not paradoxical, but heretical]*

    > **Card. Bertone O.R. 28.08.2009:** "The thought of Benedict XVI... from the texts published in the Osservatore Romano... it would not be difficult to reconstruct his project for the Church and society."

    > **Giovanni Maria Vian, director of L'Osservatore Romano also quotes "The great Church", O.R. 13.03.2009:** "This is why the unity of the Catholic Church and the ecumenical commitment are important, this is why dialogue between religions has a meaning. For this the Great Church, terms dear to tradition, must seek peace with all."

    > **Inos Biffi, O.R. 15.01.2012:** "The Church of Christ... while being concretely realized in the multiplicity of particular Churches, is rigorously one." [A great church composed of particular churches, including the Roman Catholic Church]

### On Democracy in the Church, synodality

*Ratzinger theorized democracy in the Church and Pope Francis put it into practice with synodality. From now on it will no longer be the pope who teaches but it is the people of God who discuss and vote on the doctrine, the pope only approves what the people have decided.*

*   **1972 The book by Cardinal Ratzinger: "Democratization in the Church? Possibilities, limits, risks", by Benedict XVI - Joseph Ratzinger, Hans Maier. Publisher Apostolat des éditions.**

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 04.12.2010:**
    > "Several gifts of Christianity, such as for example the idea of democratic equality" [Democratic equality is one of the 'gifts' of Freemasonry].

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 20.12.2010:**
    > "Only in compromise... can unity be re-established... in America democracy had become possible."

*   **2010 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **L'Osservatore Romano, in its Editorial of 23.07.2010:** "It is in these terms that the problem of the foundation of the Church is posed... and what we define as 'Ekklesia'. And since the heavenly Jerusalem is a city, it also includes a Council and a popular assembly."

*   **Saint Pius X, *Pascendi*, 08.09.1907:**
    > "Here we are at the Church, where their fantasies will offer us more ample material... So, what is the Church?... in times past [the modernists claimed that] it was a common error that authority came to the Church from outside, namely from God immediately; at that time, it could rightly be regarded as autocratic. But we have come a long way from that today... Ecclesiastical authority... And since this magisterium has its first origin in individual consciences, and that it fulfills a public service for their greater utility, it is quite obvious that it must be subordinated to them, thereby bend to popular forms."

### Inspiration from the "ex" Protestant Eric Peterson

*   **2010 After Card. Newman, the Osservatore Romano extols another "ex" Protestant, who inspired Benedict XVI, Eric Peterson, and who, in his writings, insinuates the Revolution in the Church.**

*   **2010-2013 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Lehmann, O.R. 23.07.2010:** "On the notion of 'Ekklesia' [this is a book by Peterson]... It is important to know in depth his life and work... The new ecumenical documents converge, on certain points, with the attempts made by Peterson."

    > **Giancarlo Caronello, O.R. 23.07.2010:** "It was Joseph Ratzinger, in an article published in 1961, who proposed a rediscovery of Peterson's theology in Catholic circles... ... With the publication of the article 'Church', by Joseph Ratzinger... one clearly perceives a rediscovery of Peterson's ecclesiology in the Catholic milieu."

    > **Hans Ulrich Weidmann on democracy in the Church taught by Peterson, O.R. 23.07.2010:** "The 'Ekklesia'... was not sovereign, but it limited itself to expressing the co-participation of the people in the acts of 'postulatio' or 'consensus'."

    > **L'Osservatore Romano, in its Editorial of 23.07.2010:** "What we define as 'Ekklesia'. And since the heavenly Jerusalem is a city, it also includes a Council and a popular assembly."

    > **Stefan Hartmann, here is the thread that connects Newman-Ratzinger-Peterson. O.R. 02.08.2012:** "Eric Peterson... His conversion to the Catholic faith in 1930 was also prepared by reading Newman... Card. Lehmann: 'Eric Peterson, a theologian of yesterday for the Church of tomorrow'... Among Peterson's essays there is: 'Ancient Church, Judaism and Gnosis'."

    > **Giancarlo Coronnello. O.R. 02.08.2012:** "Particular attention was paid to Peterson's book 'Ancient Church, Judaism and Gnosis'... his reflections on the 'Verus Israel'... The pope [Benedict XVI] referred to the 'treatises' of Peterson."

*   **2013 Thomas Söding, under the pontificate of Francis O.R. 01.05.2013:**
    > "Joseph Ratzinger and Erik Peterson... So different and so close... In 1951, Ratzinger read Peterson's 'Theological Treatises', (he says): 'There was the theology I was looking for. A theology that uses all historical seriousness to understand and study the texts, that does not leave them in the past'."

### They themselves declare that there is a new Church

"The Church of today"; "Church of the future"; "the great Church conceived by God"; "the Church as presented to us by the Second Vatican Council"; "The Church of the year 2000"; "The Church to come"; "the sacramental nature of the Church"; "a Church in syntony with the Second Vatican Council"; "multidimensional Church"; "conciliar ecclesiology"; "Eucharistic ecclesiology"; "The Church is the Church of all peoples"; "the Church of tomorrow".

*   **1988 Card. Ratzinger, Speech to the bishops of Chile, (Concilium) 1988:**
    > "The phenomenon (Lefebvrist)... would have been unthinkable without the positive elements, which have generally not found sufficient vital space in the Church of today."

*   **2001 Card. Ratzinger at the Congress of Aversa: "the great Church conceived by God". O.R. 17.09.2001:**
    > "The Church was finally recognized and experienced as something internal... In fact the Eucharist binds men to each other... and with Christ, and thus it makes them Church [Orthodox, etc.]. With this the fundamental constitution of the Church is given... The internal unity of the people of God, beyond the sacramental borders... the Church... even beyond the confines of the Catholic Church... They are possible only if one does not want or no longer manages to see the great Church conceived by God." ["The great Church"... invented by Card. Ratzinger].

*   **2007 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 13.12.2007:**
    > "The theology of our time... helps us to feel the Church as presented to us by the Second Vatican Council."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 11.11.2007:**
    > "It is necessary to change the style of organization of the Portuguese ecclesial community and the mentality of its members to have a Church in syntony with the Second Vatican Council."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 11.10.2007:**
    > "The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church:... 'Ecclesiological and canonical consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church, ecclesial communion, conciliarity and authority'." (He repeats it also in the O.R. of 29.01.2011)

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 16.10.2008:**
    > "This word 'Church' has a multidimensional meaning... concept of people of God... It opens to all peoples and unites them in a single people of God."

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 13.03.2009:**
    > "But should not it, the great Church, also allow itself to be generous, conscious of its long breath?"

*   **2010 Card. Ratzinger to present the book by Father Dario Composta on the Church in the light of Vatican II. O.R. 02.10.2010:**
    > "Canon law which was to be inserted into the theological vision of the Church formulated by the Council."

*   **2012 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 28.10.2012:**
    > "The Church is the Church of all peoples."

*   **2013 Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 16.02.2013:**
    > "The first of the reforms... was the liturgical one... the second ecclesiology; the third the word of God, Revelation... We began to put forward the concept of 'People of God'... the true reform and the true renewal of the Church."

*   **2010-2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Timothy Verdon, O.R. 30.10.2010:** "In the great Church, ... The woman represented at the side of Christ is certainly Mary... and also represents and above all 'madam the Church'."

    > **Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 27.01.2012:** "An era in the history of the Church is ending without new horizons being already visible... this will only be possible through a new pentecost... The Church of the future."

    > **Card. Kurt Koch, O.R. 24.03.2012:** "To adapt the Code of Canon Law to the decisions of the Second Vatican Council... the Pope recognizes the Code as 'the great commitment' to translate the teaching of Vatican II, and in particular the conciliar ecclesiology, into canonical language... to introduce the doctrinal decisions of the Council into the daily life of the Church."

    > **Stefan Hartmann, O.R. 02.08.2012:** "Card. Lehmann: 'Eric Peterson, a theologian of yesterday for the Church of tomorrow'."

### The new evangelization

**What is the new evangelization for Benedict XVI?**

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 18.12.2011:**
    > "Recently the Pontifical Council for the promotion of the new evangelization was created."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, definition of "new evangelization" O.R. 26.10.2011:**
    > "Migrations and new evangelization... new evangelization, to work ever more in a pluralistic context... paths of fraternal sharing... welcoming migratory flows... to become actors of the new evangelization."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation "Africae munus" O.R. 19.11.2011:**
    > "To exhort the Church, in this situation, to persevere in the esteem of 'Muslims who worship one God'... so that in Africa every citizen may enjoy... also the right to freedom of conscience.... The new evangelization."

*   **2011 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Synod of Bishops on the new evangelization "Lineamenta", O.R. 05.03.2011:** "Benedict XVI... 'court of the gentiles'... as a further reflection on the new evangelization which requires a first moment of self-control and purification... The project of the 'court of the gentiles'... the new evangelization vision for the Church of today and tomorrow."

    > **Mgr. Rino Fisichella. O.R. 22.10.2011:** "New evangelization and politics. ... creative secularism that requires joining consensus beyond diversities."

    > **Mario Ponzi. Interview with Mgr. Rino Fisichella, president of the Dicastery for the new evangelization. O.R. 12.01.2011:** "Benedict XVI instituted the new dicastery, ['the new evangelization'] involving the entire world episcopate... The episcopal conferences... are called to constitute within their structures an office similar to ours."

## The anti-theological Revolution

One can say that the errors of Benedict XVI also depend on his false philosophy and his false theology, Benedict XVI made a new theology: "my theology", "my proclamation of the Christian faith". His disciples: "a broadening of our conception of reason and its use", "renewed the inner genesis of faith", "he refounded theology", "The thought of Benedict XVI", "a new era. "A promising era of theological exegesis".

The method of Benedict XVI consists in changing the meaning of words or phrases of theology, he often uses the term "new way", the "new dimension", without explaining what it means, for example when he changes (and thus denies) the Incarnation, the Resurrection, the Ascension, the Assumption, the immortality of the soul, this pushes the reader to try to guess something that you do not understand and that he does not explain.

This is very evident when he gives a new interpretation of the Incarnation in his book "Introduction to Christianity" (Part II, chap. 4,2,1). He affirms a new way of interpreting the truths taught by the traditional Magisterium and that there is a "new way" of understanding the truths. See Annex no. 11 of this bulletin, p. 83, or see on our site, Osservatore romano anno 2020, our study on the Incarnation.

Ratzinger's book "Introduction to Christianity" whose original title is: "Einführung in das Christentum" should rather be interpreted as: "Introduction to the [new] Christianity", and Ratzinger's book: "The new people of God" is rather "The new [Christianity] of the people of God".

One must also read all the documents issued by the International Theological Commission when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was prefect and head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 1981 to 2005. Joseph Ratzinger was created a cardinal in 1977, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1981 and also became president of the Pontifical Biblical Commission and the International Theological Commission.

**Documents of the International Theological Commission of which Cardinal Ratzinger is president and head:**
1.  Theology, Christology, Anthropology (1981).
2.  Reconciliation and Penance (1982).
3.  Dignity and rights of the human person (1983).
4.  Selected themes of ecclesiology (1985).
5.  The consciousness that Jesus had of himself and of his mission (1985).
6.  Faith and inculturation (1988).
7.  The interpretation of dogmas (1989).
8.  Some current questions of eschatology (1992).
9.  Some questions on the theology of redemption (1995).
10. Christianity and religions (1997).
11. Memory and reconciliation: the Church and the sins of the past (2000).
12. Diaconate. Evolution and perspectives (2002).
13. Communion and service. Man created in the image of God (2004).

*   **1990 Card. Ratzinger, Document: "The interpretation of dogmas" ("Civiltà Cattolica", 21.04.1990)**
    > "The Church makes its own the openness and universality of the languages of man, of his images and of his concepts... The doctrine of the Church must be understood and interpreted correctly only in the Faith."

*   **2001 Card. Ratzinger, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, O.R. 01.07.2001:**
    > "One can consider as outdated the concerns of prudence and the doctrinal difficulties that determined the promulgation of the Decree *Post obitum* of condemnation of the 'Forty Propositions' [of Leo XIII] extracted from the work of Antonio Rosmini."

*   **2006 Pope Benedict XVI wants to de-Hellenize philosophy. O.R. 14.09.2006:**
    > "I must still speak briefly of the third wave of de-Hellenization that is currently spreading... this thesis is not false; it is however crude and imprecise... but of a broadening of our conception of reason and its use."

*   **2008 Pope Benedict XVI on negative theology, O.R. 15.05.2008:**
    > "Of God one can speak only with the 'no', and it is only by entering into this experience of the 'no' that one can reach him. [This is not true because there is also the 'way of excellence' which teaches us that God possesses in the highest degree all that exists.]"

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 21.11.2010, Extract from the book "Light of the World":**
    > "'Christianity and modernity'. 'Judaism'... in my proclamation of the Christian faith this loving intertwining between Israel and the Church had to be central."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 18.09.2010:**
    > "Card. Newman. He studied and renewed the inner genesis of faith... Doctor of the Church."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, on the one hand, accepts the Protestant justification, which destroyed the capacity of reason to know and on the other hand, he affirms the capacity of human reason to know the natural moral law without the help of the Magisterium.**
    > **O.R. 17.06.2010:** "Thomas Aquinas... 'Even if grace is more effective than nature, however nature is more essential to man.' (1a q. 29 a 3)... [He distorts the thought of Saint Thomas] Therefore, in the Christian moral perspective there is room for reason, which is capable of discerning the natural moral law [sic]... the dignity of the person, require a foundation. Is not the natural law this foundation, with the non-negotiable values that it indicates?"

*   **Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Bertone O.R. 28.08.2009:** "The thought of Benedict XVI... from the texts published in the Osservatore Romano... it would not be difficult to reconstruct his project for the Church and society."

    > **Card. Bagnasco, "intellectual charity" [loving error?] O.R. 02.07.2010:** "Rosmini... intellectual charity."

    > **Jan Ker. One begins to recognize that Newman is Ratzinger's master and invented "a reasonable faith": "broadened reason". O.R. 16.10.2010:** "The reasonable faith of Newman... His theology of conscience produced a very profound effect on Benedict XVI."

    > **Card. Marco Ouellet, 11.03.2011:** "I cannot but notice in this work (Jesus of Nazareth by Benedict XVI) the dawn of a new era. A promising era of theological exegesis. Its purpose is to find the real Jesus. Not the historical Jesus but the Jesus of the Gospels."

    > **Marco Tibaldi. Apologetics without miracles. The external miracle is no longer the external proof of the authenticity of Revelation, O.R. 14.01.2012:** "Not in the external indices [objective] the reason for the authenticity of Revelation."
    *[In the Catholic Church, miracles, or external signs, have always been the proof of the true religion, St. Pius X, *Pascendi*: "I admit and recognize the external arguments of Revelation"... of the divinity of Christ and of the Church. For example the miracles of Lourdes, the men of Vatican II hardly speak of them anymore].*

    > **Mgr. Müller, Ratzinger's book "Introduction to Christianity", is the fundamental text of the new Catholic religion. Mgr. G.L. Müller, O.R. 11.12.2013:** "Benedict XVI exposes... his fundamental Christological perspective presented systematically in his book 'Introduction to Christianity' (1968). ...The origin of Jesus is both known and unknown."

## The anti-philosophical Revolution

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, denies that one can demonstrate the existence of God with reason, this is one of the most heretical doctrines, because the First Vatican Council excommunicates anyone who denies that the existence of God can be demonstrated by reason. O.R. 08.04.2006:**
    > "God exists or does not exist, there are only two options... one cannot ultimately 'prove' either project, but the great option of Christianity... seems to me to be an excellent option."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI (pushes to error in two opposite directions: on the one hand he teaches the de-Hellenization of faith, denying the capacity of reason to know God (v. O.R. 14.09.2006), and on the other hand he exaggerates the capacity of reason in the sense of the Enlightenment: "To welcome the true achievements of the Enlightenment" (O.R. 23.12.2006).**

*   **In the Osservatore Romano, one continues to extol Rosmini, Newman, Romano Guardini and others. It even seems that with this method, he mocks philosophers and theologians, as the famous philosopher Emmanueli Severino denounces, cited by the same Osservatore Romano, Angelo Marchesi, O.R. 16.06.2006: The famous Italian philosopher Emanuele Severino wrote in the Corriere della sera (08.06.2006) an article: "Ratzinger, this relativist".]**

*   **1996 Card. Ratzinger in Guadalajara O.R. 27.10.1996:**
    > "I believe that neo-scholastic rationalism failed in its attempt to reconstruct the *Preambula fidei* with a reason completely independent of faith, with a purely rational certainty; all other attempts, which follow the same path, will ultimately obtain the same results. On this point Karl Barth was right to reject philosophy as the foundation of faith, independently of the latter: in this case, our faith would be based on variable philosophical theories." ["variable"?]

*   **1998 Card. Ratzinger "Faith and reason", O.R. 19.11.1998, speaking of Faith and inculturation, denies the universal value of Greek philosophy by reducing it to an optional European historical culture that is not indispensable for interpreting Revelation. On the contrary, the Greek philosophers discovered the logical way of reasoning which is universal, even if it was discovered in Greece, the same is true for mathematics: it is universal.**

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, He teaches here what constitutes the foundation of his anti-philosophical Revolution. O.R. 14.09.2006:**
    > "I must still speak briefly of the third wave of de-Hellenization which is currently spreading. ... the synthesis with Hellenism, realized in the ancient Church, would have been a first inculturation, which should not engage other cultures. These should have the right to go back to the point preceding this inculturation, to discover the simple message of the New Testament and then to inculturate it again in their respective milieus. This thesis is not false; it is however crude and imprecise... There are certainly in the process of formation of the ancient Church elements that should not be integrated into all cultures. This attempt... of critique of modern reason from within absolutely does not include the opinion that one must now go back to before the Enlightenment and reject the convictions of the modern age... the intention is therefore not a negative critique; but of a broadening [?] of our conception of reason and its use."

*   **The famous Italian philosopher Emanuele Severino wrote in the Corriere della sera (08.06.2006) an article: "Ratzinger, this relativist", the Osservatore Romano talks about it and tries, without success, to defend the Pope:**
    > **Angelo Marchesi, O.R. 16.06.2006:** "Severino writes that: 'There is a critique of relativism, considered by the Church as its most radical adversary, which has the essential characteristics of the relativism that this same catechesis wants to combat'. According to Severino, there would be a strange divergence between what Ratzinger would have written in 1986, at the request of John Paul II, the supervision of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, where it is affirmed with *Humani generis* of Pius XII that, 'Human reason with its sole forces and its natural light can truly achieve a certain and true knowledge of a personal God' and a later relation of Card. Ratzinger, in which he exposes his own theological-philosophical conception by writing something else. For example... Ratzinger, after having noted that reason always lives in particular historical contexts... wrote: 'I consider that neo-scholastic rationalism has failed in its attempt to want to reconstruct the *Praeambula fidei* with a reason totally independent of faith' (O.R. 27.10.1996). ...Ratzinger adds: 'On this point Karl Barth was right in refusing philosophy as the foundation of faith...' And Severino comments: 'This is a negative judgment of Ratzinger with respect to neo-scholastic philosophy, therefore of Thomas and of the encyclical *Aeterni Patris*, never cited in the Catechism of the Catholic Church...' On the basis of these citations then Severino writes: 'I would therefore like to invite the Pontiff not to get rid of neo-scholastic philosophy so quickly'."

*   **2007 Benedict XVI 19.11.2007:**
    > "This afternoon will be beatified in Novara the venerable Servant of God, Antonio Rosmini, great figure of a priest... to become aware that the light of human reason and that of grace, when they walk together, become sources of blessings for the human person and society."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI to the International Theological Commission. The pope himself proposes the natural law as the foundation of universal ethics and democracy: this is integral naturalism. O.R. 06.12.2008:**
    > "And they are preparing to reach a new and important goal with the document: 'In search of a universal ethic: a new look at the natural law'."

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 05.10.2009:**
    > "Christianity is not a sum of ideas... a theology." [He misses no opportunity to diminish the importance of doctrine]

*   **2008 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **L'Osservatore Romano under the pontificate of Benedict XVI, published a text by Romano Guardini which demonstrates how modernism is based on Platonism O.R. 01.10.2008:** "Guardini:... 'What matters are the convictions... This grafts me onto a line of thought from Platonism... to Augustine... to Francis... to Dante and to the Platonists of the Renaissance'."

    > **L. Possati, O.R. 08.11.2008:** "Faith and Reason in Newman and Ratzinger. A new and broader sense of rationality [?] ... Benedict XVI... 'a great master of the Church': Card. Newman." [Newman teaches that conscience is superior to the Magisterium: 'Conscience, echo of the voice of God, writes Newman is the true vicar of Christ' (v. O.R. 19.06.2006)].

    > **Prof. Francesco d'Agostino, O.R. 18.09.2008:** "Neither confessional nor, more generally, fideistic... It is not for the philosophy of divine law to fix the concrete normative contents of such a law... Divine law definitively consolidates the legal concept of person... Jesus is not King because He has the power to legislate."

    > **Guzmán Carriquiry Lecour, O.R. 27.08.2008.** "In the dialogue between Ratzinger and Habermas (faith and reason)... they must reasonably review their persistent disagreement... One must operate, according to Ratzinger... a necessary purification of religion, ... In this perspective, one understands why the Pope refers to positive secularism in the tradition of the public life of the United States."
    *[The men of Vatican II ask the State to recognize the natural 'non-negotiable' values in exchange they no longer claim the Rights of Our Lord over society. Since for the popes of Vatican II: "Peace is a supreme gift" (John Paul II O.R. 10.11.1999) and not the glory of God, we will see if by suppressing the 'rights of God' over society, the devil gives us peace, or if God, abandoned, lets the enemy unleash atomic war, reaping souls for heck. We will see.]*

    > **Card. Scola, O.R. 17.09.2008:** "The place of God's law in today's life needs to be exposed in a new light." [It is impossible to be more explicit than that, Vatican II changes the Rights of God]

    > **Interview with Mgr. Bettori. The de-Hellenization. O.R. 25.05.2008:** "'Twenty years of work... The former Card. Ratzinger rightly stressed that there is not a faith to be inculturated... This means that the whole world of Hellenic culture is not the place in which, in a second time, faith would come to be inculturated... but it is one of the contexts in which faith reveals itself through the New Testament'. In fact it is the lesson of Regensburg [See the speech of Regensburg on de-Hellenization O.R. 14.09.2006]...'This is an essential point... From this point of view the book 'Jesus of Nazareth' is very important.'"

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 30.11.2009:**
    > "However, mathematics is an invention of the human mind to understand the created."

*   **2010 Pope Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia for the Christmas greetings, O.R. 20.12.2010:**
    > "Only in compromise [doctrinal compromises] and mutual understanding can unity be re-established. To prepare people for this attitude of peace is an essential task of pastoral care... Tocqueville, in his time had observed that in America democracy had become possible and it had worked, because there existed a basic moral consensus which, going beyond the particular denominations [of religions], united them all. [This is the philosophy of Freemasonry: morality: yes, dogmas: no. That is why Cardinal Ratzinger had the excommunication of Freemasonry lifted as officially confirmed by the Osservatore Romano of 15.11.2023]... It is the future of the world that is at stake... We must learn from Newman's three conversions... if he had to propose a toast, he would have toasted first to conscience and then to the pope. [The Magisterium has always taught that the intelligence of man is obscured by original sin and that all natural truths are not accessible to the knowledge of man without the Magisterium.] To the pope can be dedicated the second toast because it is to him that the duty of demanding obedience to the truth falls." [The Pope does not teach the truth but only demands that man obey the truth that his own conscience reveals to him.]

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 13.12.2010, at a funeral, speaks like this of the immortality of the soul:**
    > "We are alive in the memory of God... God, who is our memory."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 18.03.2010:**

*   **Card. Bagnasco, "intellectual charity" [loving error?] O.R. 2.7.2010:**
    > "Rosmini... intellectual charity."

*   **Hermann Geisler recognizes that Newman did not convert O.R. 22.12.2010:**
    > "For Newman... 'From the moment I became a Catholic, I no longer had the slightest doubt... it did not seem to me to have a more solid faith in the fundamental truths of revelation... the sacramental nature of the Church... to overcome, little by little, the limits of a Church linked to a State'."

*   **2010 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI one continues to look for authors to justify the subjectivist Catholic "Augustinianism". There is a doctrinal continuity from Descartes to Rosmini, to the ontologists, to Newman, to Guardini and up to Benedict XVI.**
    > **Luca Possati O.R. 19.11.2010:** "Augustine or Aristotle? This is the dilemma... Theodoric of Freiberg... The interpretation of the thought of Augustine presented itself as an essential instrument to understand the modernity of Augustine of Hippo, [sic] which makes it an excellent introduction to the history of the philosophy of the Renaissance and of the Enlightenment... The intellect... but also causal, creative... Hence the violent attack against Thomas, 'guilty'... of having conceived the 'intellectus agens' as a faculty and not as a separate substance."

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI to the Ambassador of England, O.R. 10.9.2011:**
    > "Newman, a great Englishman whom I have admired for many years... I remain convinced of the importance of Newman's ideas on society."

*   **2011-2013 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Bertone on "Jesus of Nazareth" by Benedict XVI, the pope continues to fuel the idea that one should not be too convinced, O.R. 17.11.2011:** "Benedict XVI... thanks to the historico-critical exegesis... Ratzinger - Benedict XVI, ... The incarnation of Jesus... to look at the truth of this '*factum est*', not in the manner of absolute historical certainty, but by reading the Scripture as such in a just manner and recognizing its seriousness." [So the Incarnation is not an "absolute historical certainty", but only something "serious".]

    > **Card. Bagnasco, O.R. 13.11.2011:** "It is a question of the person who, according to the affirmation of Antonio Rosmini, 'is a subsistent right' [here is the 'extra-territoriality' of the person of Maritain]... which precedes every legislation and every human power... natural law which is the norm of positive law."

    > **Roberto Cutaia, Rosmini's error is clearly visible here. O.R. 30.10.2011:** "The metaphysics of Rosmini... by renewing it in the spirit of modernity... Rosmini understood that modernity would no longer accept the medieval system of '*quaestiones*' and even less a philosophical discourse that starts from God to arrive at a treatment on man. ... But by considering above all this divine element present in man... it is this same '*lumen*' that wrests the assent of man in the face of truth... Faith is above all an experience and not a theory... Rosmini, ... the doctor of the third millennium... intellectual charity."

    > **Mgr. Peter Henrici, bishop emeritus of Chur, in this important article highlights the history of the infiltration of subjectivism into the Church and shows us the common thread that unites the modernist authors to each other, up to Ratzinger, and today they can publish it and glorify themselves. O.R. 19.11.2011:** "New theological and philosophical attempts, intended to reconcile the Catholic faith with the modern spirit. In Italy Gioberti and Rosmini, in France, de Lammenais, Bautain, de Bonald, in Germany the school of Tübingen and Hermes, Günther and Döllinger. ... were censored by the magisterium [thank you for reminding us]. ... Newman and Blondel. but many suspicions arose about them... the Catholic encounter with modernity... I cite only the most outstanding names: Father de Lubac, Cardinal Daniélou, Hans Urs von Balthasar as well as Karl Rahner. Others, just as deserving, would be to be added to the list, such as a Joseph Ratzinger and a Karol Wojtyla, with his phenomenological Thomism. ... then became decisive at Vatican II [thank you for having recognized it]. John XXIII, strong in these openings, could convene Vatican II... the Church was rediscovering modernity. However, the majority of the thinkers, who were the precursors or the symbols of modernity were, either precursors of the Protestant reform, or themselves reformed evangelists. [He therefore says that the precursors of Vatican II are in any case the Protestants, we are in complete agreement] Rediscovering modernity, for us Catholics [sic], will be, and perhaps even the very first, an ecumenical problem."

    > **Hermann Geissler, makes an important summary of the doctrine of Newman, [therefore of his errors]. O.R. 18.09.2011:** "Newman... doctor of conscience... 'original vicar of Christ... Augustinian imprint... its character of divine law, but it still retains as such the right to be obeyed... conscience is the original vicar of Christ'... By measuring himself with the traditional proofs of (the existence) of God, Newman affirms to prefer the way that leads to God through conscience [therefore without foundation in reality]... In the 'Apology' Newman audaciously affirms: 'if you ask me why I believe in God I answer: because I believe in myself... If the Vicar of Christ spoke against conscience, in the authentic meaning of the term, he would commit suicide... If I were obliged to propose a toast to religion... I would toast, if you wish, to the Pope, but first to Conscience and then to the Pope'."

    > **Silvano Zucal, recognizes the infiltration of the theory of innate ideas into the Church. O.R. 05.06.2011:** "Saint Bonaventure in the thought of Romano Guardini... but alongside this current flows another, more occult [occult?]: the Augustinian-Platonic current, ... Of such a tradition Bonaventure is the absolute protagonist... through Anselm of Aosta... The ideas... they are the 'truth' of things... With a true passion, Bonaventure develops the concept of knowledge inherited from Augustine: 'this understanding is realized *in lumine mentis*, through a process of illumination, *per irradiationem regularum aeternorum*, by irradiation of eternal ideas in the spirit... is an experience of light... and, Guardini warns, it is not correct to understand such a word metaphorically when it appears so constantly in all of Bonaventure's work... This *lumen mentis* which is the splendor of truth... which 'gives form'... conscience, understood as knowledge of the eternal in the absolute, and the *scintilla animae'." [This still resembles the Gnostic theory that the soul is a spark of God.]

    > **Enrico dal Covolo, O.R. 21.1.2011:** "One can quietly affirm, without fear of being contradicted, that the Discourse of Benedict XVI in Regensburg, on September 12, 2006, has entered into the history of theology." [This is the fundamental speech of Pope Benedict XVI in which he declares that one cannot demonstrate the existence of God by reason, a fundamental thesis of the anti-philosophical Revolution].

*   **2012 Herman Gaissler affirms that Newman was a precursor of Vatican II and of democracy in the Church. O.R. 14.11.2012:**
    > "The theme of the 'consent of the faithful' in the writings of John Henry Newman... Among his writings... the study 'on the Consultation of the faithful in matters of doctrine' has aroused, since its publication, bitter debates... Prof. Gillow even accused him of having denied the doctrine of the infallibility of the Church. For several years, the shadow of mistrust surrounded the person of Newman... He was a precursor of later times. His thoughts, even on the mission of the lay faithful in the Church, were fully welcomed a hundred years later. Tradition manifests itself differently and according to the times, writes Newman, 'sometimes by the mouth of the episcopate, other times by the doctors, other times still by the people'. With Möhler, Newman defines the '*sensus fidei*' as the common feeling or conscience of the Church."

*   **Imbelli, O.R. 03.10.2012:**
    > "Newman whose writings strongly influenced the young theologian Josef Ratzinger."

*   **Matthew Fforde [it would be interesting to study the Anglican-Catholic infiltration], O.R. 30.05.2012:**
    > "Newman guides, and often even inspires, a whole slice of high English culture... (High Church) which then converted to Rome... In the evaluation of this exceptional school, we encounter... R.H. Benson, G.K. Chesterton, Dickens, Lewis, Tolkien... and especially T.S. Eliot converted to Anglicanism and its Anglo-Catholic current."

*   **Roberto Cutaia, important article, O.R. 20.02.2012:**
    > "A contribution to intellectual charity [sic]... Josef Ratzinger in 1985 in Lugano: 'If I look now at the great and faithful masters, from Möhler to Newman, Scheeben, Rosmini, Guardini, or in our days, to de Lubac, Congar, Balthasar, how current is their word compared to that of those whose community subject of the Church has disappeared'... [for him the community subject is collegiality and ecumenism], it is a contribution to the program of intellectual charity... 'The divine in nature', is the title of a work by Rosmini. The Second Vatican Council also speaks of 'seeds of the divine' in man." [This is the Gnostic thesis, for which man is a divine spark and not a pure creature].

*   **Mgr. G.L. Müller, speaking of magic O.R. 27.07.2012:**
    > "Benedict XVI and the courage to open up to the breadth of religion... In the lesson he gave in Regensburg, a magical moment in the history of German university, Pope Benedict XVI again highlighted the synthesis between faith and reason... It is not a question of whether God exists or not, but of the clear refusal of his presence." [In the language of the Church, the word magic is used only as the work of the devil and here they are making a revolution in language.]

*   **Card. Karl Lehmann, on the eve of proclaiming St. Hildegard a doctor of the Church, teaches that the saint practiced magic, O.R. 07.10.2012:**
    > "Saint Hildegard... the natural medicine of the saint and its direct application... also partly magic."

*   **Mgr. G.L. Müller, O.R. 21.02.2013:**
    > "The famous Regensburg lesson of Benedict XVI... Religion needs reason as a coordinating principle, possibly a purifying one."

*   **Samuel Fernández, O.R. 18.02.2013:**
    > "The invitation of Benedict XVI to a 'broadening of our concept of reason and its use'. (Regensburg, 12.09.2006). The Christian faith cannot renounce philosophy, but it cannot let itself be guided by an autonomous philosophy closed to novelty."

### Exaltation of evolutionism and the denial of "intelligent design" in nature

*   **2009 Pope Benedict XVI, very important text O.R. 26.07.2009:**
    > "The function of the priesthood is to consecrate the world so that it becomes a living host, so that the world becomes liturgy: that the liturgy is not a thing parallel to the reality of the world, but that the world itself becomes a living host, that it becomes liturgy. This is also the great vision that Teilhard de Chardin [pantheist] had: in the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host."

*   **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 05.01.2006:**
    > "History is moving towards a humanity united in Christ, it is thus moving towards the perfect man, towards the perfect humanism" [[This is the triumph of Maritain's "Integral Humanism", which Father Garrigou-Lagrange calls "Integral Naturalism"].]

*   **2009 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Card. Bertone, O.R. 28.08.09:** "On July 25 last Benedict XVI praised 'the great vision that Teilhard de Chardin had: the Pauline idea that in the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy and that the cosmos will become a living host'. The thought of Benedict XVI... from the texts published in the Osservatore Romano... it would not be difficult to reconstruct his project for the Church and society, coherently inspired."

    > **Fiorenzo Facchini, O.R. 04.07.2008:** "The recent interventions of the magisterium of the Church reaffirming creation have not excluded evolution... on the subject of evolution the theological research of... Ratzinger... Rahner has contributed."

    > **P. Armogathe, O.R. 24.10.2009:** "A dynamic ontology that takes evolution seriously... In this regard one can say that divine Providence accompanies evolution: creation proceeds towards the ultimate state for which God wanted it."

*   **Marc Leclerc O.R. 12.02.2009:**
    > "Evolution and creation do not present the slightest opposition between them, on the contrary they reveal themselves to be completely complementary... the species of homo sapiens appears at the end of an immense evolutionary process of which we are beginning to discover some secrets."

*   **Evandro Agazzi, O.R. 25.11.2009:**
    > "A non-literal reading of the Old and New Testament biblical texts may contain perspectives, from a certain point of view, that are evolutionist."

*   **2011 Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 26.04.2011:**
    > "The whole cosmos today rejoices, enveloped in the springtime of humanity."

*   **Fiorenzo Facchini against the explanation of "intelligent design" in nature, extols evolutionism in the Osservatore Romano, 16.01.2011:**
    > "It is not necessary to bother divine causality to supply or guide directly the changes of nature, as the theory of Intelligent Design supports."

*   **2012 Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI**
    > **Pope Benedict XVI subjects all the bishops of the Synod to indoctrination on evolutionism held by Prof. Werner Arber, president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.**

    > **Werner Arber at the Synod of Bishops O.R. 15.10.2012:** "Cosmic evolution and biological evolution, as factors that reveal important laws of nature... On the other hand, the continuous process of evolution of the universe and of life, are firmly established scientific facts [?] and which provide essential elements of permanent creation [?]... Spontaneous genetic variations as the driving force of biological evolution... The natural power to evolve and its impact on biodiversity... The compatibility of scientific knowledge and religious faith."

    > **Mgr. Eric De Moulins-Beaufort, O.R. 10.11.2012:** "A lawyer at Vatican II. The effort of Henri de Lubac to make known the authentic thought of his friend Teilhard... Lubac had spoken in the ante-preparatory commission to protest against Mgr. Piolanti and Father Dhanis who had introduced into a schema the condemnation of Teilhard."

    > **Piero Benvenuti, in order to save evolutionism, continues to deny, like Card. Ratzinger and his comrades, the current thesis of "Intelligent Design", O.R. 11.08.2012:** "To overcome 'Intelligent Design'... the unscientific [?] and primary naivety of 'Intelligent Design'."

    > **Paolo Becchi and Roberto Franzini Tibaldeo, O.R. 10.06.2012:** "What unites Hans Jonas to Ratzinger? Neither Darwinism nor Intelligent Design... to point out that of the scholar of Jewish origin Hans Jonas, ... primordial choice of the divinity to contain itself, that is, to renounce [?] its own omnipotence to make room for creation... to any 'Intelligent Design'. In this regard Jonas shows a singular syntony with Josef Ratzinger... his distrust of any attempt to present creationism and evolutionism as mutually exclusive alternatives... In fact in 1968... in harmony with Jonas, Ratzinger affirmed that: 'It is obvious that the spirit is not a product of material development... the spirit appears in the mode of development' [sic]. The position of Jonas can be compared to that of Ratzinger... without falling back into theoretically problematic and scientifically unsustainable positions, such as 'Intelligent Design'... it tells the divine renunciation of its own omnipotence [?]... It is a story that has its roots in the Jewish Kabbalistic tradition... to note a certain affinity... of Jonas and Ratzinger."

## Religious freedom, freedom of conscience, human rights

### In general

Against social Kingship and for religious freedom, positive, authentic and healthy secularism,... and for the secularism of the State:

Which human rights? Those of the liberal Revolution? In fact, Benedict XVI extols 
the United States. See the articles below.

> **Pope Benedict XVI, to the Ambassador of the United States, extols the use of religion to promote the democratic Revolution, O.R. 01.03.2008:**
> 
> From the beginning of the Republic, America has been a nation that has appreciated the role of 
> religious creed as a guarantee of a vibrant and ethically sound democratic order. The example

> **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 01.05.2008:**
> 
> I had the opportunity to pay tribute to this great Country [USA] ... a valid example of healthy

Pope Francis will then speak of "receptive ecumenism" (O.R. 22.01.2022), but there we 
see that the master was Benedict XVI.

*   **Pope Benedict XVI: Speech to the French President, O.R. 13.9.2008:**
    > "Mr. President, the beautiful expression of positive secularism (laïcité)."

> **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 19.04.2008:**
>

> religious freedom throughout the world.

> **Osservatore Romano, 1st page, 21.04.2008:** 
> 
> A Catholicism which, in its turn, supported Benedict XVI as he himself declared on the 
> radio: 'I must say that American Catholics are confirming me in my faith.'

What "faith"? The liberal faith!

> **Card. Ruini, O.R. 05.12.2008:** 
> 
> Benedict XVI... finds, from his Christian and liberal foundation, his own identity.

There are many other Catholic-liberal speeches by Benedict XVI in America: see Doc. Rév. In the Church year 2008.

> **Osservatore Romano, 1st page, 16.04.2008:**
> 
> The United States, a model of positive secularism. This is how Benedict XVI defined the United States.

> **Roberto de Mattei, O.R. 17.04.2008:**
> 
> The American way to Catholicism... a providential mission, which springs from the same American 
> Constitution... The United States has the mission of realizing the harmony between the Church and 
> the State, between religious principles and political principles. Brownson's vision is not however 
> confessional. In the United States the state religion... the separation between Church and State is 
> not a separation of the principles on which they are founded. [But yes, ask them and you will see 
> that they are liberal in principle] It is a question of organizing the State according to the 
> principles of the Church, without sanctioning in the legal plan any alliance whatsoever between 
> the Church and the State. This can be realized at the level of the natural law.

> **2009 Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 02.02.2009:**
>   
> "It is up to the State to effectively ensure to citizens and religious communities the freedom of worship 
> and religious freedom..., whatever their religion."

> **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 09.05.2009:**
> 
> "Religious freedom is certainly a fundamental human right... in every part of the world."

> **Card. Paul Josef Cordes, denies that there is a third way between liberal capitalism and Marxism. O.R. 08.07.2009:** 
> 
> The first encyclical of Benedict XVI 'Deus caritas est'... this implies that the social doctrine of the 
> Church is not a third way, that is, a political program to be realized.

> **Card. Bagnasco CEI, O.R. 21.9.2009:**
> 
> The Pope: 'the Church has no technical solutions to offer and does not 
> claim in any way to meddle in the politics of States'.

### Benedict XVI also wants to secularize other religions

> **2006: Pope Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia: "It is necessary to welcome the true achievements of the Enlightenment" O.R. 23.12.2006:**
> 
> On the occasion of my meeting with the philosopher Jürgen Habermas... faith, for its part, needs the colloquy with modern reason... 
> In a dialogue to be intensified with Islam, we must bear in mind the fact that the Muslim world today is urgently facing a task very 
> similar to that which was imposed on Christians since the time of the Enlightenment and which the Second Vatican Council, the fruit 
> of a long and painful search, has led to concrete solutions for the Catholic Church... On the one hand one must oppose a dictatorship 
> of positivist reason which excludes God from the life of the community and public institutions... on the other hand it is necessary 
> to welcome the true achievements of the Enlightenment, Human Rights and especially the freedom of faith and its exercise.

In a single week, Benedict XVI quotes a text that criticizes Muhammad, then he apologizes twice to the Muslims and ends by blessing them, 
after they themselves, **in that same week, to take revenge, killed a nun and burned churches**. What will the popes of Vatican II do in the 
face of the current Islamic invasion?

> **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 18.09.2006:** 
> 
> I am truly saddened by the reactions aroused by a brief passage of my speech at the University of 
> Regensburg, considered offensive to the sensitivity of Muslim believers, when it was a quotation 
> from a medieval text that in no way expresses my personal thought.


> **Pope Benedict XVI continues to apologize to Muslims before the Diplomatic Corps, O.R. 21.09.2006:**
> 
> I did not in any way want to make my own the negative words spoken by the medieval emperor in this dialogue, 
> and their polemical content does not express my personal conviction.

> **The Pope blesses Muslims, O.R. 25.09.2006:** 
> 
> At the moment when, for Muslims, the spiritual journey of the month of Ramadan begins, I address to all of them 
> my cordial wishes, wishing that the Almighty may grant them a serene and peaceful life. May the God of peace 
> fill you with the abundance of his blessings, as well as the communities you represent.

> **Osservatore Romano, Pope Benedict XVI lets Prof. Ali Bardakoğlu say in his presence that Christ is a prophet, on the same level as Muhammad. 30.11.2006:** 
> 
> From Adam to Noah, from Abraham to Moses, from Christ to Muhammad, these prophets were the precursors of the call to peace, love and wisdom.

> **Pope Benedict XVI O.R. 04.05.2009:**
> 
> Human rights... These rights have been ratified by almost all the States of the world. Vatican II, in the 
> declaration *Dignitatis humanae*, and my predecessors Paul VI and John Paul II have strongly referred to the 
> rights concerning freedom of conscience and religion, central rights that emanate from human nature itself." 

And then they complain that globalism instead of 'positive secularism' imposes the right to abortion, homosexuality, euthanasia, 
gender, etc... See chapters VI and VII on "lamentations".

> **2009: Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI, Card. Kasper proposes to bring the Enlightenment to the Orthodox, O.R. 05.09.2009:**
> 
> Backward Orientals... whom we must help to pass into modernity. [They say that the Orthodox need a Vatican II]... 
> In the East the ecumenical idea encounters, in many cases, strong reservations, not to say real oppositions. 
> For some, ecumenism is an insult and a super heresy." [It is true that they are schismatic and heretical but 
> they have understood that: "ecumenism is an insult and a super heresy."]

> **Card. Tauran wishes for the secularization of Hinduism, O.R. 17.10.2009:** 
> 
> Dear Hindu friends, ... Respect for others, and therefore the recognition of their freedom: freedom of conscience, of thought and of religion.

> **Abderrazak Sayadi. The Vatican scandalizes Islam by denying the superiority of the rights of God over human rights, O.R. 13.03.2009:**
> 
> The third motivation, represented by the position of Saudi Arabia, is religious. It considers that Divine Law is superior to human law and 
> that the law of God, as fixed by the ulemas in the sharia, is superior to the law of man... These hold that these texts are always current.

The 'Christians' of Vatican II, yes, but the popes before Vatican II, who condemned the secularism of the

Benedict XVI in London doctrinally establishes "positive secularism" and thus denies the social Kingship of Jesus Christ. Monsignor 
Lefebvre in his book: "They have uncrowned him" denounces the error of affirming that reason, in the rules of politics and society, does not need Revelation.

This is why Muslims persecute Christians, because they have seen the Pope support the United States.

"Inseparable" from Jewish roots, yes: usury, international financial capitalism etc. While the Church has rather condemned usury.

In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI in Lebanon speaks against the superiority of the Catholic religion, openly denies Catholic 
religious tolerance and praises liberal religious freedom:

> **Pope Benedict, officially declares himself for the equality of religions. O.R. 16.09.2012:**
> 
> Only then can good understanding between cultures and religions grow, esteem for one another, without a sense of superiority and in respect for the 
> right of each of them... These values belong to the rights of every human being. In the affirmation of their existence the various religions make a 
> decisive contribution... The so-called tolerance does not eliminate discrimination, sometimes it even reinforces it... Religious freedom has a social 
> political dimension indispensable to peace.

> **Pope Benedict XVI on leaving Lebanon, O.R. 17.09.2012:**
> 
> "The communion between all its inhabitants, whatever their community and their religion... May God bless you all."

> **Pope Benedict XVI, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of "Pacem in terris", O.R. 30.04.2012:**
>

> to it, can bear fruit, and will certainly bear fruit.

So the "order established by God" is the liberal order, the naturalism of "Pacem in terris" where for the first time and 
in a very lucid way, everything is founded on human rights and exclusively on human nature.

> **Pope Benedict XVI, O.R. 26.11.2012:**
> 
> Jesus knows... that the kingdom of God is of a completely different kind, ... and not of a political kingdom.

There is no Catholic politics, nor Christian laws, nor Christian law, etc... The historical Christian society 
has no politics, nor law, nor Christian laws?

> **Pope Benedict XVI "Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Church in the Middle East, O.R. 14.09.2012:**

These "some" are all the Popes before Vatican II.

And then they complain that the States eliminate the conscientious objection of Catholics against anti-Christian laws.

> which will only be welcomed by John XXIII in his encyclical 'Pacem in terris' of 1963." 

Finally they admit what the 'prince' of Vaticanists, Zizola, a socialist, had already said: *"No pope has reached the charism of John XXIII."*

### Liberty, equality, fraternity

>

This is the "hermeneutic of continuity" with Masonic doctrine.

> **2010: Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI, Card. Tauran, O.R. 7.8.2010:**

### Benedict XVI in favor of secular globalism

The damage and mockery: the popes of Vatican II complain because after having accepted the secularism of the State with religious 
freedom, democracy with collegiality-synodality and universal fraternity with ecumenism, nevertheless globalism does not recognize 
the importance of the Church and increases cultural and physical persecution. We see that it is a matter of the anti-Christian 
plot: "Everything is already decided and determined by an elite of people" (O.R. 29.10.2010). So some churchmen, unable to hide 
the reality, complain timidly, feigning to be surprised by the plot against the Church, while knowing that there are about 580 
magisterial documents against Masonic-liberal naturalist globalism. However even if the Revolution mocks them, the popes stubbornly 
continue to teach liberal principles and to repent of Christian civilization.

### Lamentations of the popes of Vatican II against globalism

This is what they taught and accepted, the secular State, and now they complain about the consequences of secularism. Paul VI did the same thing, 
first by signing the documents of Vatican II, then complaining about "the self-destruction of the Church by its ministers" (07.12.1968) and that 
"the smoke of Satan has entered the Temple of God" (29.06.1972).

The popes and bishops, with Vatican II, made doctrinal compromises with liberalism, but the liberals marginalized them and progressively persecuted them. 
The problem of the popes of Vatican II is and will always be the same: to accept or believe in the principles of the liberal Revolution. The popes before 
Vatican II had understood and denounced liberalism, but it is precisely Card. Ratzinger who introduces the ideas "of modernity" into the Church. 

Card. Ratzinger declares it officially and with authority in the famous interview with the magazine Jesus (Nov. 1984): "Yes, the problem of the 
sixties was to acquire the better expressed values of two centuries of liberal culture" (liberty, equality, fraternity.) This is the spirit of Benedict XVI.

> **2011 Pope Benedict XVI to the Ambassador of Austria, O.R. 4.2.2011:**
> 
> The political authorities are very careful not to concede public spaces to religions.

> **2011: Under the pontificate of Benedict XVI, Card. Bagnasco Speech of introduction to the Permanent Council of the CEI, O.R. 24.01.2011:**
>

> countries with a democratic tradition, starting with those of Europe... There is a secularist aggressiveness. 
> A subtle evil, in fact, is afflicting Europe, causing a slow and underground marginalization of Christianity.

> **Bruno Bouvet, O.R. 17.01.2011:**
>

Today the Revolution attacks this same modernist Church in an operational, orchestrated way in favor of secularist secularism, (v. O.R. 04.02.2011).

> **Osservatore Romano, 04.02.2011:**
> 
> Democratic societies still do not manage to understand appropriately the debt they have to the Christian heritage. [Can they not? Or do they not want to?]... 
> To the fathers (conciliar) escaped two explosive dimensions of modernity: science and subjectivist individualism. ... The fathers of Vatican II neglected 
> the most virulent aspects of modernity.

It is officially declared that 'the fathers of Vatican II' were therefore incapable: 'To the fathers (conciliar) escaped'... and 
negligent: 'neglected'. The worst, however, is that the popes persist in introducing ever more deeply and precisely the errors of 
liberalism into the Church.

### Lamentation of the Synod of Bishops for the Middle East

The synod declares that the support of Benedict XVI for the Jews and the Americans incites anti-Christianity among Muslims.

> **2010 "Lineamenta" for the Assembly for the Middle East of the Synod of Bishops O.R. 20.01.2010:**
> 
> "The emigration of Christians... today, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has intensified... The conflictual political 
> situation between Palestinians and the Arab world on the one hand and Israel on the other. Too often our countries identify 
> the West with Christianity.

This is a plan aimed at increasing the hostility of Muslim immigration towards Christians in Europe.

> **Patriarch Antonios Naguib O.R. 18.10.2010. However, he extols here the sum of modernist errors:**
>
